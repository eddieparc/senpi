## 2026-09-30 - Sync with upstream v0.99.1 (6a4af07d6): chord, client, protocol, server, telemetry, sqlite-node

### What changed

- `packages/server/package.json`: resolved by L11 against upstream v0.99.1 (6a4af07d6): upstream constructs adopted, fork behavior kept.

### Why

Upstream v0.99.1 (6a4af07d6) changed these paths while the fork carries its own behavior; chord/client/protocol/server/telemetry/sqlite-node take upstream versions with fork exact pins (plan D-12).

### Why an extension could not handle it

Package manifests and wire-protocol packages are shared infrastructure below the extension layer.

### Expected merge conflict zones

Every path listed above conflicts again where upstream edits the hunks named in its line; the fork-kept constructs named there are the anchors to preserve.

## 2026-09-21 - Migrate the test runner to Vitest 5 (senpi#1895)

### What changed

- `packages/server/package.json`: Updated the test runner to Vitest 5.0.1.

### Why

- Run this workspace on the pinned Vitest 5 release.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The package manager resolves development tools before extensions load.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- The development dependency pins in `packages/server/package.json`.

## 2026-09-12 - Pin the chord dependency to upstream's published version

### What changed

- packages/server/package.json: `@earendil-works/chord` is pinned to the exact upstream `0.85.1` it resolves to, instead of a fork CalVer range.

### Why

- chord is bundled but kept on upstream's own release identity (issue #1632): the fork does not publish it, so a CalVer range was unresolvable on the registry and broke `bun add @code-yeongyu/senpi`. Pinning the exact published `0.85.1` keeps the declared edge resolvable while the bundled copy shadows it at runtime.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- packages/server/package.json is static manifest data consumed by the package manager and the release/publish pipeline, never reachable from the runtime extension system.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- The `@earendil-works/chord` dependency range in packages/server/package.json.

## 2026-09-12 - Remove the ai-to-protocol mapper with the protocol v8 adoption

### What changed

- `packages/server/src/protocol.ts` (the `toProtocolModelMetadata()` / `toProtocolAssistantMessage()` / `toProtocolUserMessage()` / `toProtocolToolResultMessage()` bridge), `packages/server/test/protocol.test.ts`, and the matching re-export in `packages/server/src/index.ts` are deleted (C13). Upstream replaced the mapping layer with service-addressed RPC routed through `src/session-router.ts` and deleted `packages/protocol/src/schemas.ts`, so the DTOs the mapper produced no longer exist.
- The 2026-09-04, 2026-08-25, and 2026-08-13 blocks below that describe `protocol.ts` field accounting remain as history; they no longer name live code.

### Why

- Keeping a mapper for schemas upstream removed would mean re-inventing the wire contract inside the fork; the server now forwards opaque service envelopes and never decodes business payloads.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The server package sits below the extension layer; the wire contract is not something an extension can shape.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/server/src/index.ts` exports and any upstream change that reintroduces a typed mapping module; expect fork-side deletions, not edits.

## 2026-09-10 - Use native TypeScript builds for omob performance

### What changed

- packages/server/package.json: build uses tsgo for the emitted workspace build.

### Why

- The native compiler reduces omob build time without changing runtime JavaScript.

### Why this lives in the fork

- The package build manifest owns the compiler used by the fork's release pipeline.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- The `build` script in packages/server/package.json.

## 2026-09-04 - Account for providerThinkingLevel in the protocol types

### What changed

- `packages/server/src/protocol.ts`: the AssistantMessage field-accounting assertion gains `providerThinkingLevel`, mirroring the field the v0.84.4 sync added to the shared AI message type (upstream 4e69b0c28).

### Why

- The server protocol type must stay in lockstep with the shared AssistantMessage shape; the exhaustiveness assertion fails compilation when a field is added upstream but not accounted for here.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The protocol type is the compiled wire contract shared by server and clients; extensions operate above it.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `packages/server/src/protocol.ts` field-accounting list whenever upstream extends the AssistantMessage shape.

## Server manifest re-diverges from upstream dcd4619 (2026-08-25)

### What changed

- `packages/server/package.json` keeps `@code-yeongyu/senpi-server`, calver, senpi description and
  keywords, and `tsc` builds (upstream uses `tsgo`).

### Why

These are fork-owned product surfaces (senpi branding, provider wire behavior, fork runtime features) that upstream does not carry; the sync must re-assert them on top of upstream's tree.

### Why this lives in the fork

The divergence lives in core wiring, package identity, or build plumbing that executes before any extension loads, so no extension hook can express it.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- The name/version/scripts blocks on every upstream release bump.

## 2026-08-25 - Account for provider abort provenance in transcript typing

### What changed

- `packages/server/src/protocol.ts`: includes the optional assistant `abortSource` field in the exhaustive pi-ai transcript shape check.

### Why

- Provider retry watchdog ownership is part of the assistant message contract and must remain explicit across server protocol boundaries rather than being dropped or rejected by compile-time drift checks.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The server protocol bridge owns the exhaustive transport type contract before extension consumers run.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `AssistantMessage` exact-key assertions in `src/protocol.ts`.

## Repository-wide changes.md audit backfill for package manifest and transport typing (2026-08-17)

### What changed

- Backfill from the repository-wide changes.md audit (pin 914cf147, tag v0.84.2): records the remaining fork deltas on upstream-owned server production paths. The protocol-field compatibility deltas in `packages/server/src/protocol.ts` remain tracked by the 2026-08-13 entry below.
- `packages/server/package.json`: renamed to `@code-yeongyu/senpi-server`, marked `private`, moved to CalVer `2026.8.16`, retargeted the description, keywords, and repository URL to senpi, switched the `dev`, `build`, and `typecheck` scripts from `tsgo` to `tsc` with the TypeScript 7 native toolchain, and bumped the workspace dependencies to the `^2026.8.16` lockstep range.
- `packages/server/src/testing/client.ts` and `packages/server/src/transports/unix/listener.ts`: annotated the `socket.on("data")` chunk as `Buffer` so the zero-copy `Uint8Array(chunk.buffer, chunk.byteOffset, chunk.byteLength)` view construction typechecks against the upgraded Node type surface; runtime behavior is unchanged.

### Why

- The fork keeps the experimental server private and outside the publish matrix, versions it in lockstep with the CalVer release set, and compiles it with the same `tsc` toolchain as the rest of the workspace, so the manifest deliberately diverges from the upstream `@earendil-works/pi-server` identity, SemVer, and `tsgo` scripts.
- The typed chunks keep the unix transport and its protocol test client compiling under the fork's newer Node type definitions without weakening the byte-view handoff to the connection handler.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Package identity, versioning, publish privacy, compiler selection, and transport socket typing are package-manifest and type-level contracts evaluated before the server runtime or any extension loads.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `packages/server/package.json` name, version, private flag, scripts, and dependency lines whenever upstream re-versions or changes toolchain.
- LOW: the `data` handler annotations in `packages/server/src/testing/client.ts` and `packages/server/src/transports/unix/listener.ts`.

## Protocol compatibility fields (2026-08-13)

### What changed

- Preserved video-modality allowance in protocol exact-key checks.
- Preserved tool-call `incomplete` and `errorMessage` fields alongside upstream
  deferred assistant-message support.

### Why

- Senpi transports incomplete tool-call recovery metadata and video-aware
  messages across the server protocol boundary.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- These are transport schema keys validated before server consumers or
  extensions receive the decoded messages.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `src/protocol.ts`, in `ExactKeys` manifests and assistant/tool-call
  conversion switches.

## Upstream sync (upstream/main@71dca871) integration repairs (2026-09-12)

### What changed

- `packages/server/package.json`: stays `@code-yeongyu/senpi-server 2026.9.12` (`senpi` keyword, `code-yeongyu/senpi` repository, `private: true`), `tsc` for `dev`/`typecheck`, `@earendil-works/chord`/`pi-agent-core`/`pi-protocol` at `^2026.9.12` plus the fork's `@earendil-works/pi-ai` runtime dependency, `vitest 4.1.11`.
- `packages/server/src/testing/client.ts`: upstream service-addressed test client with the fork `(chunk: Buffer)` typing on the socket data handler.
- `packages/server/src/transports/unix/listener.ts`: upstream `ServerListener` with `.bind-` ownership and stale-socket cleanup, with the fork `(chunk: Buffer)` typing on the socket data handler.

### Why

- The server publishes under the fork name and lockstep, and the fork's `@types/node 26.2.0` requires explicit `Buffer` typing on socket chunks.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Manifest identity and transport source typing are compile-time concerns of the server package.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `socket.on("data", ...)` handlers in both source files; `packages/server/package.json` name/version/dependency lines.

## 2026-10-02 - Server drops its agent-core dependency (D-16) (upstream v1.0.0 sync)

### What changed

- `packages/server/package.json`

The server package's dependency set follows upstream: `pi-agent-core` is removed and `BACKGROUND_CONTEXT` imports from `@earendil-works/chord/context`.

### Why

Upstream simplified the server's dependencies; the fork modifies nothing here.

### Why an extension could not handle it

Package dependency declarations are not an extension surface.

### Expected merge conflict zones

Upstream server manifest edits at the next sync.
