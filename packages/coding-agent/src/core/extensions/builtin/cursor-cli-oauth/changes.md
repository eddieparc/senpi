# cursor-cli-oauth extension changes

## 2026-09-25 - The turn prompt keeps the user's request when hidden messages follow it (senpi#2139)

### What changed

- `stream.ts`: `lastUserPrompt` -> exported `turnPrompt`, which joins every user-role message after the last non-user message (the current turn), in order, instead of taking only the last one. With no trailing user message it falls back to the last user message as before.
- `test/cursor-cli-oauth/stream.test.ts`: a turn of [request, hidden reminder] keeps the request at the head (RED with the old last-message rule); earlier turns are not included.

### Why

- A turn can carry hidden extension messages that reach providers as user messages after the request (the todotools first-turn plan reminder, senpi#2121). The CLI takes one prompt, so sending only the last user message sent the reminder alone: on `cursor-cli-oauth/claude-opus-5` and `gpt-5.6-sol` the model answered that the request was empty and did nothing.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- This is the lane's own prompt assembly.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `turnPrompt` and its call site in `streamCursorCliOauth`.

## 2026-09-23 - `normalizeEntries` copies derived variant ids into `cursorReasoning` (senpi#2038)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/cursor-cli-oauth/models.ts`: `normalizeEntries` copies `entry.variantIds` into `compat.cursorReasoning.variantIds` when `normalizeCursorCatalog` derived a group from ids the static alias table does not list, mirroring `packages/ai/src/providers/cursor.ts` `fetchCursorModels`. Static-table entries keep byte-identical output (the field spreads in only when present); `-fast` variants stay flat. The cache now retains the original CLI listing, rebuilds the models from that listing on every read (the saved `models` projection carries mutable state such as observed context windows, which must not invalidate a fresh cache), and re-probes cache records without a listing instead of trusting their grouped ids; such a pre-listing record is still returned (rebuilt from its `id`/`name` pairs, as before this change) when that re-probe fails or yields nothing, so an offline start keeps the cached catalog rather than dropping to the static fallback. Test: `packages/coding-agent/test/cursor-cli-oauth/cursor-cli-derived-variants.test.ts` exercises probe, cache reload, exact wire selection, listing-based rebuild, pre-listing re-probe and its offline fallback, and cache reuse after a context-limit observation.

### Why

- A live `cursor-agent models` listing now contains level families (grok-4.7-low..-xhigh) the static tables cannot know. Without the copy, this lane grouped them but dropped the level-to-variant-id map, so the core resolver could not map legacy references and every explicit level fell back to the representative variant. Previously cache reload normalized grouped ids as raw ids, erasing the metadata and sending a nonexistent base wire id; a grouped cache row cannot reconstruct its members without the listing.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `normalizeEntries` is this builtin's private catalog boundary feeding provider registration; the variant-id map must exist on the registered `ProviderModelConfig` before any other extension can observe the models.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/cursor-cli-oauth/models.ts`: the `cursorReasoning` object literal inside `normalizeEntries`, `CachedModelCatalog`, `parseCachedCatalog`, and the probe-to-cache write path.

## 2026-09-15 - Startup `cursor-agent models` probe: lane-gated, account HOME, explicit env (senpi#1722)

### What changed

- New `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/cursor-cli-oauth/environment.ts`: `cursorAgentEnvironment(home)` is the single child environment for every cursor-agent spawn - `HOME` = the given account HOME, `AGENT_CLI_CREDENTIAL_STORE=file`, plus `PATH`/`TERM`/`LANG`/`LC_ALL`/`FORCE_COLOR` passthrough (`CURSOR_AGENT_ENVIRONMENT_PASSTHROUGH`). `transport.ts` uses it instead of its private copy; behaviour there is byte-identical.
- New `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/cursor-cli-oauth/models-probe.ts`: `runModelsProbe({ executable, stdoutPath, timeoutMs, home })` moved out of `models.ts` and now spawns with `cursorAgentEnvironment(home)` instead of the inherited `process.env`; typed `CursorCliModelProbeTimeoutError` / `CursorCliModelProbeExitError` replace the bare `Error` strings.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/cursor-cli-oauth/models.ts`: `resolveCursorCliModelCatalog` no longer owns a default probe; `deps.runProbe` is required because only the caller knows which HOME (and therefore which account) the listing must come from. Cache-first behaviour, TTL, parsing, and the static fallback are unchanged.
- New `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/cursor-cli-oauth/catalog-refresh.ts`: `refreshCursorCliModelCatalogForLane` runs the startup refresh through `assessConfiguration` (now exported from `oauth-login.ts` together with its `ConfigurationOutcome` union) and resolves `undefined` without spawning for `disabled`, `not-installed`, and `no-accounts`; for `configured` it probes inside `runInCursorAccountHome` for the pinned account (else the first usable one), so `cursor-agent models` lists the models of the account senpi will actually use.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/cursor-cli-oauth/index.ts`: the unconditional `resolveCursorCliModelCatalog` call is replaced by the lane-gated refresh; the static catalog still registers first and is only swapped when a probed catalog arrives. New injectable `runModelsProbe` seam in `CursorCliOauthExtensionDeps`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/cursor-cli-oauth/executable.ts`: `probeCursorAgentVersion` passes `cursorAgentEnvironment(homedir())` (`VersionProbeOptions.env`) instead of inheriting the parent environment.

### Why

- Every senpi process start spawned `cursor-agent models` whenever the catalog cache was missing or stale - even with the lane disabled or no account bound, which the turn path and `check` refuse - and did so with the full inherited environment. cursor-agent runs a macOS keychain preflight (`security add-generic-password -a cursor-keychain-probe ...`) whenever it sees an SSH/mosh marker (`SSH_CLIENT`, `SSH_CONNECTION`, `SSH_TTY`, `MOSH_*`, `VSCODE_SSH_*`), and when the child's `HOME` has no login keychain that call blocks on a GUI "Keychain Not Found" dialog on the logged-in console. SSH-launched hermetic senpi processes (the test suite's RPC/e2e fixtures, sandboxes) reproduced it on every start and leaked one `senpi-cursor-models-*` temp dir per killed probe.
- The transport already had the right allowlist; the probe paths simply did not share it. One module now owns the contract.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The spawn sites, the registration-time refresh, and the executable/version probes are this builtin extension's private process boundary; nothing outside it can narrow the child environment or gate the startup spawn.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: fork-new directory. `index.ts` registration tail, `models.ts` deps/type block, `transport.ts` env helper removal, `executable.ts` version probe, and the two `export` keywords in `oauth-login.ts` conflict only with concurrent hardening of this lane.

## 2026-09-10 - `/cursor-account` renders the display names the generic rename can write (senpi#1495)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/cursor-cli-oauth/accounts.ts`: `CursorCliAccountSlot` carries optional `displayName`; immutable `name` stays the operational identity and the sentinel invariant is unchanged.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/cursor-cli-oauth/account-command.ts`: the listing, the "Pinned account" line and the "Affinity pick" line render `accountLabel(...)` (`displayName (name)`) instead of the bare ID, matching the Claude lane. Pinning, removal, import, affinity and status output still address accounts by ID only.

### Why

- `/account <provider> rename ...` accepts any provider, so a cursor account can already hold a label; without these two paths the label was write-only for this lane — visible in `/account cursor-cli-oauth list` and nowhere in `/cursor-account`.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Both paths are this provider extension's own slot type and command surface; the shared locked rename lives in core below them.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: slot shape in `accounts.ts`; the three rendering sites in `showAccounts` in `account-command.ts`.

## 2026-09-11 - Detect same-tick settings rewrites

### What changed

- `settings.ts`: the cached provider-settings loader now keys its manager cache on a SHA-256 content revision rather than `mtimeMs:size`, so a rewrite made within one filesystem mtime tick is observed.

### Why

- Linux filesystems can preserve the same mtime for two rapid writes, leaving the loader with stale provider settings despite its re-read contract.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The cache and its invalidation key are owned by this provider extension's settings loader.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `settings.ts` around `settingsFingerprint`.

## 2026-08-24 - Keep provider tool protocol out of assistant text

### What changed

- `stream.ts`: Cursor `tool_call` events are no longer serialized into `<cursor-cli-tool>` assistant text. They also remain intentionally unmapped to host `toolCall` blocks because Cursor already executed them in its subprocess. The suppressed events still close the preceding text segment and reset cumulative-snapshot tracking without creating an empty stored block, so post-tool prose is preserved.
- `stream.test.ts`: the tool-turn regression now proves that text deltas and stored assistant content contain only the model's prose before and after both started/completed tool frames, including a post-tool cumulative fragment sharing the pre-tool prefix.

### Why

- Rendering provider protocol as text mixed long JSON blobs into the TUI and persisted untrusted tool arguments/results in conversation context.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The pollution happened inside the builtin provider before OmO or another extension received the assistant message, so the provider boundary is the only layer that can remove it without post-processing legitimate model prose.

## 2026-08-21 - Cache provider settings loads by mtime+size to cut lock convoy

### What changed

- `settings.ts`: `loadCursorCliOauthProviderSettingsFromDisk` caches the `SettingsManager` instance keyed on (cwd, mtimeMs:size of the global and project settings.json). A cache hit skips `SettingsManager.create` and its two locked disk reads; environment overrides are re-parsed on every call so live env changes take effect immediately.

### Why

- `fallbackEligible()` calls this loader on every retry-fallback candidate probe. A fresh `SettingsManager` per call took the cross-process settings lock twice and read+parsed both files; under error storms this multiplied into hundreds of locked disk reads per session per error, driving the lock-retry busy-wait (fixed in core) that froze the TUI.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- This IS the extension side: the cache is local to the provider settings loader.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `settings.ts` around `loadCursorCliOauthProviderSettingsFromDisk`.


## 2026-08-19 - Guaranteed-refusal lane leaves implicit fallback expansion

### What changed

- `guardrails.ts`: new exported `cursorCliForceRefusalPending(settings)` names the exact condition under
  which unattended agent-mode execution is refused (force requested outside plan mode without
  `noApprovalAcknowledgedAt`); `resolveCursorCliExecutionPolicy` now delegates to it so the policy and
  the eligibility hook can never disagree.
- `index.ts`: the provider registration passes `fallbackEligible`, returning false while the lane is
  kill-switched (`explicitlyDisabled`) or the refusal is pending. Bare-family fallback expansion skips
  the lane in those states; explicit selection, `/login`, and `/cursor-account` are unaffected. A merely
  flagless lane stays eligible because an explicit senpi-side login is the opt-in.

### Why

- With a managed account present the lane held an OAuth credential and ranked tier 0 in bare expansion,
  so shipped default chains routed fallback hops into it; each hop then hard-errored with the
  acknowledgement message instead of serving. Tests: `test/cursor-cli-oauth/fallback-eligibility.test.ts`.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- This IS the extension side: the deterministic signal rides the new `ProviderConfig.fallbackEligible`
  registration field (see `core/extensions/changes.md` 2026-08-19).

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `index.ts` provider registration object; `guardrails.ts` around `resolveCursorCliExecutionPolicy`.

## 2026-08-19 - Ambient cursor-agent auth becomes explicit opt-in

### What changed

- `settings.ts`: `cursorCliOauthProvider.enabled` now defaults to **false**
  (it defaulted to true since the 2026-08-18 bootstrap change). The resolved
  settings gained `explicitlyDisabled`, which is true only when the last layer
  that names `enabled` set it to `false` verbatim - a settings file, a project
  settings file, or `SENPI_CURSOR_CLI_OAUTH_ENABLED=0`. Env precedence over
  project over global over default is unchanged; `explicitlyDisabled` is derived
  from the same layer order as the value itself.
- `oauth-login.ts`: new exported `isCursorCliOauthLaneEnabled(settings,
  storedAccountCount)` holds the whole rule, and `assessConfiguration` now reads
  the stored account slots before applying the flag. A verbatim `enabled: false`
  still short-circuits to `disabled` before any credential or executable work.
- `stream.ts`: the turn-time gate uses the same predicate - the kill switch
  throws `disabled by settings` up front, and the flagless, account-less lane
  throws the same message once the stored slots are known, so `check` and the
  turn path cannot disagree.
- `index.ts`: the native-credential bootstrap gate (`canBootstrap`) keeps
  requiring the flag and additionally refuses when the kill switch is set. With
  the new default this means an installed, logged-in host `cursor-agent` no
  longer causes senpi to copy that credential into a managed slot.
- `AGENTS.md`: the "Default-on remains opt-out" invariant is replaced by the
  explicit opt-in invariant and the `check` outcome list is clarified.

### The stored-account rule and why

With the flag absent, **stored usable accounts keep the lane available**. Those
slots only exist because the user ran `/login cursor-cli-oauth` or
`/cursor-account import` (both persist `enabled: true` through
`persistCursorCliOauthEnabled`, so this is a belt-and-braces path for stores
written before that persistence existed, or edited by hand). An explicit
senpi-side login IS the opt-in; forcing a second settings edit after it would
hide credentials the user deliberately gave senpi. Only the ambient lane - the
host-CLI-derived native credential bootstrap - requires the flag. This matches
the claude-sdk-oauth semantic (`enabled` defaults false, stored OAuth accounts
and `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN*` env accounts stay available without it), so the
two ambient-auth lanes behave identically.

One deliberate difference from a pure "flag gates ambient only" reading: a
verbatim `enabled: false` remains a hard kill switch that also hides stored
accounts. That preserves the existing documented opt-out (`enabled: false` /
`SENPI_CURSOR_CLI_OAUTH_ENABLED=0` disables the lane) and its tests; without
the `explicitlyDisabled` distinction, flipping the default to false would
silently turn that kill switch into a no-op for anyone with stored accounts.

### Why

- The lane reported itself AVAILABLE merely because a vendor CLI happened to be
  logged in on the host: `cursor-agent` installed plus a native `cursor`
  credential was enough for the bootstrap reader to mint a managed account and
  for `check` to report `configured`. Spending a user's Cursor subscription
  needs senpi-side consent, not host state.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- This IS the builtin extension that owns the provider's settings contract,
  credential reader, availability predicate, and turn path. No external hook can
  change a builtin provider's default settings or its `oauth.check` verdict.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: fork-only `settings.ts` (`DEFAULT_SETTINGS`, `resolveSettings`),
  `oauth-login.ts` (`assessConfiguration` head), `stream.ts` (the settings gate
  at the top of the turn body), `index.ts` (`canBootstrap`). Conflicts are
  expected only against concurrent hardening of this same lane - notably the
  parallel claude-sdk-oauth opt-in change, which touches its own directory.

## 2026-08-18 - Cursor CLI lane reasoning + catalog normalization

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/cursor-cli-oauth/spawn-model.ts` (new): resolves one
  `--model` argv element per turn from the shared cursor selection resolver.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/cursor-cli-oauth/stream.ts`: resolves the spawn model
  once and uses it for both session routing and every failover spawn.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/cursor-cli-oauth/models.ts`: the CLI listing, the cached
  catalog, and the offline static fallback all normalize through the shared grouping, replacing the
  label-derived context-window heuristic with the live capability table.

### Why

- The CLI lane is the second Cursor surface: senpi reasoning levels must drive it through the same
  abstraction, and its label heuristic reported stale windows (e.g. Grok 4.6 as 200K).

### Why an extension could not handle it

- This is itself the builtin extension that owns the lane's catalog and subprocess spawn arguments.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `models.ts` entry construction, `stream.ts` spawn/turn-input sites.

## 2026-08-18 - Default-on native credential bootstrap

### What changed

- `settings.ts`: `cursorCliOauthProvider.enabled` now defaults to true. Explicit
  settings/environment false values remain authoritative.
- `native-bootstrap.ts`: new default managed-credential reader. After the
  enabled and executable gates pass, it copies a usable native `cursor` OAuth
  credential into one canonical `native` slot when managed accounts are
  empty. It re-checks the target inside `CredentialStore.modify`, shares only
  in-flight concurrent reads, preserves existing/incompatible credentials,
  never writes the native provider, and returns the previous state on errors.
  The reader repeats the enabled/executable gate for direct reads outside
  `assessConfiguration` (notably explicit login), so a cancelled login cannot
  bypass `enabled:false`.
- `index.ts`: the builtin registration uses the bootstrap reader only for its
  default `readCurrent`; injected readers keep their existing test/embedding
  behavior.
- Native Cursor login now refreshes the fallback provider in the same
  interactive completion pass; that shared-file change is tracked in
  `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/interactive/changes.md`.

### Why

- A valid native Cursor login plus an installed `cursor-agent` already
  satisfies the fallback lane's real prerequisites. Requiring a second login,
  a settings edit, or `/cursor-account import native` hid otherwise usable
  models and duplicated setup work.
- Startup and native-login refreshes can overlap, so a lock-rechecked,
  in-flight-deduplicated reader is required to avoid duplicate `native-*`
  accounts.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The bootstrap owns the builtin provider's private credential reader and
  authentication check boundary. External hooks cannot change the default
  settings contract, atomically write the managed provider credential before
  availability is computed, or extend core post-login refresh scoping.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: fork-only `native-bootstrap.ts`, `settings.ts`, and `index.ts`.
- LOW: `interactive-mode.ts` post-login refresh option construction, tracked
  separately in the nearest interactive `changes.md`.

## 2026-08-18 - Activate explicit login/import and copy native Cursor credentials

### What changed

- `settings.ts`: provider activation now uses the same locked
  read-modify-write path as the no-approval acknowledgement.
  `persistCursorCliOauthEnabled()` preserves every sibling setting, and a
  successful acknowledgement writes `enabled: true` together with
  `noApprovalAcknowledgedAt`.
- `oauth-login.ts`: successful OAuth login requests persisted enablement even
  when the user declines unattended tool execution. The new
  `importNativeCursorCredential()` copies a usable flat OAuth credential from
  the primary `cursor` provider into a canonical named account slot; it never
  writes or deletes the source credential.
- `index.ts`: the real builtin registration now wires both acknowledgement
  and enablement persistence into the OAuth config, instead of leaving the
  login-time acknowledgement as an unwritten optional callback.
- `account-command.ts`: `/cursor-account import native` explicitly copies the
  primary provider credential. Local and native imports persist enablement
  and run a scoped offline availability refresh so the current session's
  model selector updates without restart.

### Why

- The fallback provider registered its model catalog but remained hidden after
  successful login/import because `cursorCliOauthProvider.enabled` defaulted
  false and the explicit actions never changed it.
- Users with a valid native `cursor` OAuth credential had to copy token
  material by hand into the fallback provider's sentinel `accounts[]` shape,
  risking accidental removal of the primary credential.
- The login acknowledgement prompt claimed success but the production
  registration did not supply the persistence callback.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- These are the fallback extension's private OAuth, settings, account-command,
  and provider-registration boundaries. No external extension can rewrite the
  builtin provider's credential shape, add persistence to its login callback,
  or refresh its private model-runtime availability after import.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: fork-only `settings.ts`, `oauth-login.ts`, `index.ts`, and
  `account-command.ts`; conflicts are expected only with concurrent hardening
  of the same Cursor CLI OAuth lane.

## 2026-08-17 - Initial builtin fallback lane

Plan: `.omo/plans/cursor-cli-oauth.md`. Probe evidence: `local-ignore/qa-evidence/20260817-cursor-cli-p-lane/`.

### What changed

- New builtin extension `cursor-cli-oauth`: runs senpi turns through the official `cursor-agent` CLI in print mode (`-p <prompt> --output-format stream-json --stream-partial-output --trust`, plus `--model`, `--resume`, `--force`, `--mode plan`, `--sandbox` when configured) instead of the native api2.cursor.sh protobuf provider. The native `cursor` provider stays the first-party primary path; this lane is the documented fallback for when the native path misbehaves or Cursor's own agent harness is explicitly wanted.
- Registration is unconditional: `index.ts` registers the provider with the offline static model catalog first and swaps in the probe-backed catalog asynchronously, so a missing, hanging, or broken `cursor-agent` never hides or delays the lane. The oauth `check` reports exactly one of `configured (file-store, <n> accounts)`, `disabled by settings`, `cursor-agent not installed: <guidance>`, or `no accounts: run /login cursor-cli-oauth`.
- Auth is file-store only. Each account gets a durable sandboxed HOME at `<agentDir>/cursor-cli-oauth/accounts/<slot>/home` holding `.cursor/auth.json` (`accessToken`/`refreshToken`/`apiKey: null`/`bedrockCredentials: null`, mode 0600 inside 0700 directories), rewritten immediately before every spawn and read back afterwards to persist rotated refresh tokens. The child environment is an explicit allowlist (`HOME`, `PATH`, `AGENT_CLI_CREDENTIAL_STORE=file`, `TERM`, `LANG`, `LC_ALL`, `FORCE_COLOR`). There is no ambient lane: the only code that reads the user's real Cursor store or keychain is the explicit `/cursor-account import` command, and imported tokens are copied into a slot, never referenced. `CURSOR_API_KEY` is never set; the system keychain is never written.
- Multi-account support: sentinel top-level credential fields (`cursor-cli-oauth-managed`) with real tokens only inside `accounts[]`; HRW (rendezvous) session affinity duplicated inside this extension; block windows (`rate_limit` bounded by server hint else 60 s, capped at 48 h; `auth_error` until re-login); failover rotates accounts only before any visible assistant delta and always starts a fresh chat with a user-visible notice - chat context is never transferred between accounts because each account's chats live in its own HOME.
- Session routing: sticky `{accountName, chatId, lastModel}` per senpi session, captured from `system/init.session_id`. Switching models mid-session keeps the same chat id via `--resume` and prepends a one-turn 8 KB context recap from senpi's own records; resume failure or a classified `context_overflow` starts a fresh chat with the recap and surfaces a notice. Prompt plus recap is shrunk to the 130 KB argv ceiling before spawning and only then errors.
- Context ownership stays with senpi (load-bearing): `usage.input` is senpi's own `estimateTokens` of the payload it actually spawned, `usage.output` is the CLI's reported `outputTokens`, and `cacheRead`/`cacheWrite`/`totalTokens` stay 0; the CLI's `inputTokens`, `cacheReadTokens`, and `request_id` live only in a `cursor_cli_oauth_cli_usage` assistant diagnostic for telemetry. No core compaction file is modified and no `session_compact` handler is registered, so the F1-F4 compaction wedge classes from the Claude lane cannot arise.
- Guardrails for unattended execution: `--force` is emitted only when `noApprovalAcknowledgedAt` is set - otherwise the first attempt is a typed refusal naming the exact acknowledgement step; `executionMode: "plan"` never forces; `forceExecution: false` in agent mode warns once per session (the CLI auto-rejects tool calls without force and the model then fabricates output); sandbox modes are limited to the probe-proven `enabled`/`disabled` with one warning per rejected value; deny lists are sanitized to exact full commands and applied per-spawn as `permissions.deny` `Shell(<command>)` entries in the account HOME's `cli-config.json`, composing with CLI-owned keys.
- Lifecycle safety: children spawn detached in their own process group and are killed by tracked pid (SIGTERM to the group, SIGKILL after a 5 s grace) on abort and on `session_shutdown` - never by name matching (senpi #823 regression class); every deferred continuation is fenced per extension generation so a retired generation is never touched after a reload (senpi #866 regression class).
- Missing-CLI UX: `CursorAgentNotInstalledError` carries the `curl https://cursor.com/install -fsS | bash` guidance and the `~/.local/bin` PATH note; the executable resolution chain is env override -> settings -> PATH probe -> newest `~/.local/share/cursor-agent/versions/*`; `/cursor-account status` reports the file-store lane, senpi as context owner, chat id, last model, executable path and version with a one-time below-floor warning (minimum known-good `2026.08.11`), block windows, and recommends the native provider when it is also configured.

### Why

- The native Cursor provider is the primary path; a fallback lane was needed for protocol drift or transport failures on the native path, and for users who explicitly want Cursor's own agent-harness behavior (its tool execution, its model ladder).
- The CLI refuses the OAuth session token as an API key but accepts the same token through its file-based credential store, so per-account HOMEs give credential isolation, separate chat histories per account, and immunity to a locked macOS keychain.
- Keeping senpi as context owner avoids the Claude-lane compaction wedge: `estimateContextTokens` treats the last assistant usage as the authoritative context base, so CLI-reported context numbers must never reach `usage` fields - they would make senpi demand a compaction only the CLI could perform.

### Why an extension boundary could not avoid it

- A builtin provider must appear in two core-owned lists that have no external hook: `extensions/builtin/index.ts` (the `builtinExtensions` registry array plus its import) and `provider-display-names.ts` (the display-name map the `/login` and auth-status surfaces read). Those two files are this lane's entire shared-file footprint; see the companion entry in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/changes.md`.
- Usage isolation must happen inside the provider's own `streamSimple` before the assistant message commits - no extension hook can quarantine the CLI's numbers after that boundary.
- Executable resolution, credential injection, and the spawn env allowlist sit at the private subprocess boundary this extension owns; nothing outside it can observe or narrow them.

### Expected merge-conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `extensions/builtin/index.ts` at the import cluster and the registry array beside the `claude-sdk-oauth` entry - every new builtin lane edits the same two hunks.
- LOW: `provider-display-names.ts` map rows (one-line additions in a sorted literal).
- LOW: this directory is fork-new, so conflicts arise only if upstream lands a lane of the same name. Within it, `stream.ts`, `oauth-login.ts`, `settings.ts`, and `account-command.ts` are the active iteration surfaces during hardening.
