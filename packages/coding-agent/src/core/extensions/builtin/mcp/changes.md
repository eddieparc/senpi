# mcp Extension Changes

## Explicit pgrep match-all pattern for process-tree collection (2026-08-12)

### What changed
- `process-tree.ts` now passes `.` as the positional match-all pattern to `pgrep -P`.
- `killPids` now skips any non-positive or PID-1 entry before signaling, as defense in depth against a broken or substituted discovery executable returning a catastrophic target.
- `test/suite/regressions/issue-823-mcp-pgrep-pattern.test.ts` places a deterministic fake `pgrep` first on PATH and proves unrelated PIDs are excluded, and that PID 1 is never signaled even when discovery returns it.
- `test/mcp/transport.test.ts` uses the same explicit pattern in its child-PID helper.

### Why
- Some `pgrep` implementations interpret `pgrep -P <parent>` without a positional pattern as a broad process query. The explicit `.` keeps collection limited to the requested parent on macOS and Linux.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone
- MCP stdio shutdown owns the private descendant-collection helper; an external extension cannot change the process tree selected before shutdown.

### Expected merge conflict zones
- LOW: `process-tree.ts` `childPids`; `test/mcp/transport.test.ts` test-only child discovery helper.

## Anthropic native deferral delegated to shared tool search (2026-08-11)

### What changed
- Removed MCP's provider-request/response native-search handlers and bound only the session's resolved `nativeToolSearch` setting into the shared tool-search adapter.
- Kept the former MCP module path as a compatibility re-export for existing internal imports; implementation ownership now lives under the shared builtin.

### Why
- One session-scoped adapter must inject inactive schemas from both MCP and extension catalog sources, enforce one 400 fallback state, and avoid duplicate provider hooks.

### Expected merge conflict zones
- LOW: `index.ts` beside command and session lifecycle registration.
- LOW: `expose/native-search.ts` compatibility re-export.

## Shared tool-search catalog feeder (2026-08-11)

### What changed
- Tier-B MCP registration now feeds MCP tool documents and a stub-aware activation hook into the shared tool-search service instead of registering a separate MCP-owned `tool_search` definition.
- MCP promotion, eval lazy activation, skill reveal, and ownership-aware/legacy rehydration all route through the same feeder hook.
- Active-set ordering now identifies sortable tools by shared catalog membership while preserving base-tool reference order; legacy stale MCP registrations are still removed during catalog replacement.
- The superseded MCP-local search tool, BM25 engine, and lazy-activator modules were removed. Proxy mode now uses the shared BM25 engine without changing its gateway contract.

### Why
- A single registered search tool must cover both MCP and extension catalogs without duplicate builtin-name precedence or split activation history.
- Routing every matched name through the MCP hook preserves stub-to-full replacement even when a stub is already active.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone
- MCP retains ownership of exposure policy, naming, proxy mode, stub swapping, skill-carried server reveal, and catalog refresh generations; only the builtin can translate those semantics into the shared catalog contract.

### Expected merge conflict zones
- HIGH: `expose/tier-b.ts`, `expose/session.ts`, `service.ts`, and `index.ts` around catalog registration and lifecycle wiring.
- MEDIUM: MCP search, rehydration, and eval test suites now target the shared service.

## Session-scoped control inventory bridge (2026-08-11)

### What changed
- The MCP service now captures wire inventory for RPC sessions as well as app-server threads and serializes explicit
  refreshes so concurrent connection/catalog transitions cannot overwrite a newer snapshot.
- Live snapshots include the server's connection/config state and notify session-local listeners only after the
  machine-readable inventory changes.
- The builtin registers a private resource-event-bus bridge for the control host to request and subscribe to its own
  session's snapshot. Lifecycle teardown removes both request and change listeners on reload, replacement, and quit.

### Why
- Multi-session RPC creates one MCP service inside each provider scope, so the process-global classic getter cannot
  identify the service belonging to a routing handle. The bridge keeps MCP status/tool inventory attached to the same
  session that loaded it and prevents cross-session leakage.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone
- The MCP builtin can expose its private service through the extension event bus, but only the RPC host can correlate
  that inventory with control requests and emit routed invalidation events.

### Expected merge conflict zones
- LOW: `index.ts` session lifecycle wiring.
- MEDIUM: `service.ts` wire-status refresh and notification paths.
- LOW: additive `control-inventory.ts` and status metadata in `service-types.ts`.

## Strip invalid null-valued MCP schema types (2026-08-04)

### What changed
- `expose/schema-compat.ts` now omits JSON-null `type` keywords while
  recursively resolving MCP tool input schemas into TypeBox definitions.
- Valid JSON Schema null types remain unchanged, including `type: "null"` and
  union arrays such as `type: ["string", "null"]`.
- `test/mcp/schema-compat.test.ts` covers root, nested property, and combiner
  branch null values plus both valid null-type forms.

### Why
- Some MCP servers emit `type: null`. JSON Schema permits the string `"null"`
  but not the JSON null value; strict OpenAI-compatible providers reject the
  malformed tool definition with HTTP 400 before the model can answer.
- Sanitizing at MCP conversion protects every provider adapter that receives
  the registered tool, rather than patching one provider-specific wire path.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone
- The MCP builtin owns conversion from external `tools/list` schemas to the
  registered `ToolDefinition`. Other extensions cannot rewrite that private
  schema conversion before the tool enters the shared provider pipeline.

### Expected merge conflict zones
- LOW: `expose/schema-compat.ts` recursive `$ref` copy loop.
- LOW: `test/mcp/schema-compat.test.ts` schema-conversion cases.

## Session-expiry retry uses the full service reconnect (2026-08-03)

### What changed
- `health.ts` now routes a session-expired tool call through
  `reconnectMcpNow()` before retrying, instead of renewing only the transport.
- The retry therefore reuses the same service callback as
  `/mcp reconnect <server>`: reset reconnect state, refresh auth, invalidate
  catalog readiness, renew the transport, recollect the catalog, update cache
  metadata, and restore resource subscriptions.
- The retry remains bounded to one attempt. A renewed session that also
  expires is still marked suspended with the existing actionable reconnect
  guidance.

### Why
- Some MCP servers require a fresh catalog/list handshake after a new transport
  session is initialized. Thin `connection.renew()` skipped that handshake, so
  the retry immediately expired again and left the server suspended even
  though the explicit `/mcp reconnect` path could recover it.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone
- The recovery must invoke the process-owned MCP service's private reconnect
  callback, which owns auth refresh, catalog cache state, and subscriptions.
  An external extension can call the exposed tool but cannot replace the
  builtin's guarded tool-call retry boundary.

### Expected merge conflict zones
- LOW: `health.ts` session-expiry retry branch.
- LOW: HTTP MCP fixture options and session-expiry regression tests.

## Classic reload preserves unchanged MCP servers (2026-07-26)

### What changed
- Classic (non-provider-scoped) MCP reloads keep the shared `McpService` alive. The reload-time `session_start` reattaches it and its existing config-hash reconciliation preserves unchanged servers while replacing changed definitions and disposing removed definitions.
- Provider-scoped MCP services still dispose on `reload`, because rebuilding an extension factory creates a new scoped instance and preserving the old one would orphan its child processes.
- Core now emits `{ type: "session_extensions_removed", reason: "reload", removed: Array<{ path, resolvedPath }> }` on the old runner after it knows the rebuilt extension set. MCP matches its builtin identity (`<builtin:mcp>`) in that event and disposes the preserved classic service when MCP is disabled during a reload.
- `/mcp reconnect <name>` remains the explicit escape hatch for a server that is connected but wedged: it renews that server without requiring a full reload.

### Why
- Spawning every MCP server again on every classic reload adds a fixed process startup cost even when config is unchanged. Preserving and reconciling retains healthy children, while the removal event closes the only gap where the preserved singleton otherwise loses its owning extension.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone
- The core alone can identify removed extension entries but must remain resource-agnostic; MCP alone cannot know the post-reload builtin set at `session_shutdown`. The core event provides the lifecycle boundary and MCP owns the service-specific disposal.

### Expected merge conflict zones
- LOW: `index.ts` lifecycle handlers; `service.ts` remains the config-hash reconciliation owner.

## Raced background registration replays session state (2026-07-21)

### What changed
- `service.ts` (`#syncFromConfig`): the `registerDirectTools` continuation that
  runs when a raced startup connect finishes in the background now also
  (a) replays `#rehydrateFromSessionHistory` from the stored session context
  and (b) rebuilds the session `<mcp_instructions>` block via
  `refreshMcpInstructionsForSession`. Both were captured once at attach
  completion, which — after PR #260 routed cold lazy servers through the
  bounded startup race — can predate the backgrounded connect, so a resumed
  session lost its restored (tool_search-promoted) tools on the first turn
  and the first turn's system prompt carried no server instructions.
- Tests: `rehydration-wiring.test.ts` awaits the raced registration before
  asserting the first-turn payload; `instructions.test.ts` attaches the
  harness session explicitly and awaits registration; mcp suites broadly
  await raced background completion via new fixture seams
  (`awaitMcpToolRegistration`/`awaitMcpTool` in `fixtures/register-call.ts`,
  `awaitMcpConnected` in `fixtures/service-lifecycle.ts`).

### Why
- The attach-time replay and instructions capture assume the catalog exists
  when attach returns. The startup race deliberately breaks that assumption
  for slow servers; the background continuation must refresh every piece of
  session state derived from the catalog, not just the tool registrations.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone
- The continuation lives inside the MCP builtin's startup-race plumbing;
  only the builtin holds the session context, tier-B registration, and the
  instructions module state.

### Expected merge conflict zones
- LOW: `service.ts` `#syncFromConfig` raced-connect options block.

## Non-blocking startup for cold lazy servers + configurable startup window (2026-07-21)

### What changed
- `service.ts` (`#syncFromConfig`): every startup connect now runs through
  `raceMcpStartupConnect` — the branch condition became
  `shouldRaceMcpStartup(lifecycle) || cachedCatalog === undefined`. A cold
  `lazy` server (no cached catalog) previously took a fully-blocking
  `connectAndRefreshMcpCatalog` awaited in `Promise.all(connects)`, so a slow
  or wedged server (e.g. codegraph stuck indexing) gated `attachSession` ->
  `before_agent_start` -> the first turn and the TUI silently swallowed
  prompts. Now the connect is bounded by the startup race and finishes in the
  background; a cached lazy server still needs no startup connect.
- `startup-race.ts`: added `MCP_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_ENV`
  (`SENPI_MCP_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_MS`) and `resolveMcpStartupTimeoutMs`, plus an
  optional `deadlineMs` on `RaceMcpStartupConnectOptions` threaded into
  `waitForMcpStartupRace`. Env override (global) > per-server config > default
  `MCP_STARTUP_RACE_MS` (250); non-numeric/negative env ignored, `0` = never
  wait.
- `config-schema.ts` / `config.ts`: new per-server `startupTimeoutMs` field
  (default 250), sitting beside `connectTimeoutMs`/`requestTimeoutMs`.
- `docs/mcp.md`: documents `startupTimeoutMs` (required by
  `scripts/check-mcp-docs.test.mjs`).

### Why
- A single misbehaving MCP server must never block the agent from starting a
  turn. The eager/keep-alive paths already backgrounded slow connects via the
  250ms startup race; the lazy cold path was the one remaining place that
  blocked. Extending the same race to it closes the "prompt does nothing" bug
  and makes the wait window operator-tunable.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone
- The blocking connect lives inside the MCP builtin's session-attach path;
  only the builtin owns per-server lifecycle, the catalog cache, and the
  startup race primitive.

### Expected merge conflict zones
- LOW/MEDIUM: `service.ts` `#syncFromConfig` connect branch; `startup-race.ts`
  option/plumbing; `config-schema.ts`/`config.ts` timeout field lists.


## Trust-aware merge for extension-declared MCP servers (2026-07-17)

### What changed
- `config-schema.ts`: added `"extension"` to the `McpServerSource` union;
  exported `McpServerDeclaration` and `validateMcpServerDeclaration`.
- `config.ts`: added `resolveExtensionMcpServer` (preserves declared
  `exposure`/`directTools`/filters/lifecycle/`enabled`, defaults stdio `cwd` to
  the extension's registration cwd) and `mergeExtensionMcpServers` with
  trust-aware rules: trusted file sources win (including `enabled:false`),
  extension declarations replace `untrusted` placeholders with a diagnostic.

### Why
- The new `pi.registerMcpServer()` extension API needs a merge seam that
  respects the existing trust model: user config must still win, and untrusted
  project placeholders must not block extension-provided defaults.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone
- The merge runs inside the MCP builtin but consumes runner-aggregated
  declarations; the builtin cannot know trust rules or normalize server configs.

### Expected merge conflict zones
- MEDIUM: `config.ts` around `resolveSkillMcpServer` and the trusted/untrusted
  merge helpers.

## Attach extension-declared MCP servers on every session attach (2026-07-17)

### What changed
- `service-types.ts`: `McpSessionContext` gained optional
  `getRegisteredMcpServers`; `McpServerSnapshot` gained a `source` field.
- `service-snapshot.ts`: populates `source` from the resolved server.
- `status.ts`: status rows now render `origin=<source>`.
- `service.ts`: `attachSession` calls `mergeExtensionMcpServers` from
  `ctx.getRegisteredMcpServers()` on every invocation, so session start,
  reattach, and `/mcp` command paths all pick up current declarations.
- `docs/mcp.md`: documented the `extension` source and cross-linked to
  `extensions.md`.

### Why
- Declarations are aggregated by the runner, but the MCP builtin must read them
  from the context on every attach to survive reattach and reload without
  caching stale declarations.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone
- The runner owns the aggregation and context accessor; the builtin only sees
  the narrow `McpSessionContext` passed into `attachSession`.

### Expected merge conflict zones
- LOW: `service.ts` `attachSession` ordering.
- LOW: `status.ts` row format.

## Overview
Built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) client support as an in-tree builtin
extension. Fork-native: upstream pi-mono deliberately ships no MCP support, so
every file under `builtin/mcp/` is fork-owned. Uses the exact-pinned official
`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and the public `pi.*` extension API only.

## W5 — skills-carry-MCP, proxy, resources, prompts, elicitation, logging (2026-07-08)

### What changed
- New `skills.ts` (todo 37): skills declare MCP servers via an `mcp.json`
  sidecar (wins) or SKILL.md frontmatter `mcp:` block; declared servers resolve
  through `config.ts#resolveSkillMcpServer` (source `"skill"`, forced
  search-mode/no-directTools = 0 pre-load tokens) and register via
  `service.attachSkillMcpServers`; loading a skill (`/skill:` input or the
  model reading its SKILL.md) reveals includeTools glob matches through the new
  `McpTierBRegistration.activate`.
- New `expose/proxy.ts` (todo 38): `exposure:"proxy"` collapses a server to one
  `mcp_<server>` gateway (search/describe/call, JSON-string args) reusing BM25
  and the factored `register.ts#executeMcpCatalogEntry`; policy gains mode
  `"proxy"`; auto never selects it.
- New `resources.ts` (todo 39): `mcp_list_resources`/`mcp_read_resource`
  utility tools (only when resources exist), `@mcp:<server>/<uri>` input-event
  mention expansion, per-resource subscriptions + updated notifications riding
  the tools-changed refresh.
- New `prompts.ts` (todo 40): listed prompts register as `/mcp:<server>:<prompt>`
  commands (ctx.ui argument collection -> prompts/get -> editor injection).
- New `elicitation.ts` (todo 41): EMPTY `{}` capability declared at client
  construction (`transport.ts#buildMcpClient`), flat-primitive form flow over
  ctx.ui, decline without UI / on URL-mode, bounded cancel timeout.
- New `logging.ts` (todo 42): notifications/message -> per-server logger with
  RFC-5424 mapping, `logLevel` filtering, 10/s burst cap.

### Why
- W5 of the MCP plan: capability surface (skills/resources/prompts/elicitation/
  logging) on top of W4's exposure machinery, reusing the activation path,
  guarded call path, and notification refresh loop instead of new plumbing.

### Expected merge conflict zones
- MEDIUM: `expose/session.ts` / `expose/tier-b.ts` (registration input/return
  shapes grew: proxyGateways, utilityTools, McpSessionRegistration).
- LOW: `connection.ts` connect-time subscriptions; `index.ts` event wiring;
  `service.ts` skill/prompt/resource accessors.

## Rehydration wiring + single-flight attach (2026-07-08)

### What changed
- `expose/tier-b.ts`: `registerMcpTierBTools` now returns a
  `McpTierBRegistration` handle (`searchable` + `rehydrateFromHistory`) instead
  of a bare searchable array; the rehydrate closure replays history activation
  markers through the SAME activation path `tool_search` uses (stub swap +
  stable ordering), skipping already-active names.
- `service.ts`: stores the tier-B handle per registration and exposes
  `rehydrateActiveToolsFromHistory(messages)` plus a once-per-registration
  `maybeRehydrateFromHistory` for per-turn context events. Attach now replays
  session history (via the new optional `sessionManager.getEntries` on
  `McpSessionContext`) right after direct-tool registration, so a resumed
  (`--continue`) session's FIRST wire payload already carries previously
  promoted tools — the per-turn context event replay alone landed one turn
  late because the request tool snapshot precedes it.
- `index.ts`: attach is single-flight. `session_start` handlers are dispatched
  fire-and-forget, so a cold server's attach (awaited catalog collection) could
  still be in flight when `before_agent_start` fired; the old `attached`
  boolean then started a SECOND concurrent attach that registered an empty
  catalog for turn 1. `before_agent_start` now awaits the memoized in-flight
  attach promise. Also subscribes `context` as the rehydration safety net.

### Why
- `rehydrateActiveToolsFromHistory` was exported and unit-tested but never
  invoked from the session lifecycle — resumed sessions lost all promotions
  (W4 real-surface QA driver, CLAIM 5). The double-attach race intermittently
  left ALL MCP tools off the wire for the first turns of any cold session
  (CLAIMs 1/3 flaking). Both were invisible to in-process tests and caught
  only by asserting on captured `body.tools` wire payloads.

### Expected merge conflict zones
- MEDIUM: `service.ts` around `attachSession`/`#registerDirectTools` (W5 will
  touch registration for skills-carry-MCP).
- LOW: `expose/tier-b.ts` return-shape consumers; `index.ts` event wiring.

## W4 implementation — Tier-B adaptive tool exposure + local tool-search (2026-07-08)

### What changed
- New `expose/bm25.ts`: zero-dep BM25 (k1=0.9, b=0.4) over tokenised
  name+description with a server-name field boost; normalised exact-name match
  (hyphen/underscore/case-insensitive) short-circuits before BM25; snake/camel/
  kebab tokenizer; deterministic ranking (tie-break by ascending name).
- New `expose/tool-search.ts`: always-active `tool_search` tool that ranks the
  full catalog and promotes matches via `setActiveTools` (union, stable-sorted,
  effective next turn). Results embed a stable `[tool_search:activated]` marker;
  `rehydrateActiveToolsFromHistory` replays activations after compaction/restart,
  restoring only names still in the catalog.
- New `expose/tier-b.ts`: completes `exposure:"auto"`. A server above
  `searchThreshold` enters SEARCH mode — full catalog registered, only
  directTools active, `tool_search` active. Prompt-cache mitigations: stable
  name sort; activation turns accept a cache miss (default mode); opt-in
  `settings.stubSwap` registers 30-70-token stubs so the tools array is
  length-stable and only the promoted entry's bytes change (stub -> full).
- `expose/policy.ts`: `mode` is now `"direct" | "search"`; the W1 `pending-W4`
  register-all-active fallback + warning is removed. `exposure:"search"|"proxy"`
  and threshold-exceeded resolve to search mode.
- `expose/register.ts`: extracted `mapMcpCatalogNames` so the full-tool builder
  and the Tier-B search catalog share one collision-resolved naming source.
- `expose/session.ts`: registration routes through `registerMcpTierBTools`.
- `expose/status.ts`: `/mcp status` reports total exposed tools + a search-mode
  hint (`N active now, M searchable via tool_search`).
- New `expose/native-search.ts` (todo 33, Anthropic half — spike verdict
  GO-pure-extension): `addAnthropicNativeToolSearch` injects the native
  `tool_search_tool_bm25_20251119` tool + per-tool `defer_loading:true` under
  the HARD RULES (never defer the search tool, never defer+cache_control on one
  tool, >=1 non-deferred, <=10k tools), idempotently per rebuilt request;
  `AnthropicNativeToolSearchAdapter` disables native + falls back to local
  tool_search on an injected 400. `index.ts` registers a `before_provider_request`
  (inject) + `after_provider_response` (400 detector) handler pair — a no-op
  unless `settings.nativeToolSearch` is auto|true and the model is
  anthropic-messages. The OpenAI half is deferred (spike = GO-with-ai-seam;
  needs a feat(ai) seam + sign-off — see native-search-spike.md).
- New `notifications.ts` (todo 35): closes the codex list_changed gap.
  `subscribeMcpListChanged` registers tools/resources/prompts list_changed
  handlers on the SDK client regardless of declared capability (gemini
  robustness); `connection.ts` calls it on every successful connect so
  notifications reach `markToolsChanged`. `createMcpListChangeCoalescer`
  collapses a 300ms burst into one refresh under a max-1/s/server burst guard
  (uses `safeTimer`). `service.ts` wires a per-server coalescer to
  `onToolsChanged` and, on refresh, re-lists + re-registers via
  `registerToolsPreservingActiveSet` so ADDED tools enter INACTIVE (rug-pull
  defense) and REMOVED tools are tombstoned (`buildMcpTombstoneDefinition` — a
  stale execute throws "tool no longer available on <server>"); the delta is
  recorded per server for `/mcp status` (`formatMcpListChangedDelta`).

### Why
Large MCP servers (30+ tools) blow the context budget if every tool is resident.
Tier-B keeps inactive tools at ZERO payload contribution (proven by
before_provider_request/context.tools capture: a 30-tool search-mode server
resides in <1k tokens) while `tool_search` gives the model on-demand access. This
is the provider-agnostic P3 path that ships regardless of the native-search
spike outcome (todo 29).

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone
Nothing in core needed changing: promotion uses the public
`setActiveTools`/`getActiveTools`/`registerTool` surface and the documented
next-turn activation semantics. `registerToolsPreservingActiveSet` counters the
loader's auto-activation of newly registered tools.

### Expected merge conflict zones
- `expose/policy.ts` (MEDIUM): W1 exposure tests updated to the new search-mode
  behaviour; a concurrent policy edit would collide.
- `expose/session.ts` / `expose/register.ts` (LOW): additive routing + one
  extracted helper.
- `expose/status.ts` (LOW): status line format.

## W3 implementation — OAuth 2.1 + token store + bearer/header auth (2026-07-07)

### What changed
- New `builtin/mcp/auth/` subtree implementing spec §7 auth end-to-end:
  - `token-store.ts`: URL-bound credential store at
    `<agentDir>/mcp-auth/<sha256(serverUrl)>/tokens.json` (dir 0700, file 0600),
    atomic tmp+rename writes, cross-process `proper-lockfile` read-modify-write
    (`update`/`withLock`/`writeUnlocked`), `index.json` name→hash map, and
    `clear()`. No keychain (headless-first).
  - `oauth-provider.ts`: SDK `OAuthClientProvider` backed by the store — PKCE
    verifier + client info + tokens persistence, single-use CSRF `state`,
    RFC 8707 `validateResourceURL`, `invalidateCredentials`, token fingerprint
    logging.
  - `oauth-refresh.ts`: preemptive refresh at expiry−5min with in-process
    single-flight + cross-process lock; `assertS256Supported` (typed refusal);
    `invalid_grant`→drop→needs_auth vs transient→bounded-retry distinction.
  - `oauth.ts`: discovery (RFC 9728→8414→OIDC) + S256 pre-flight refusal,
    `beginAuthorization`/`completeAuthorization`/`finishAuthorization`,
    `clientCredentialsGrant`, `logout`.
  - `callback.ts`: lazy 127.0.0.1 loopback listener (OS or fixed port with
    fail-fast on conflict), single-use state, 5-min unref'd timeout,
    `openCallbackChannel` with `oauthCallbackUrl` override → zero listeners.
  - `context.ts`: `resolveAuthMode` (#158 autodetect: headers/explicit disable
    OAuth), `resolveServerAuth` provider factory, `detectLiteralBearerWarnings`.
  - `commands-auth.ts` + `commands-auth-dispatch.ts`: `/mcp auth`,
    `auth-start`, `auth-complete <redirect-url>`, `logout`, client_credentials;
    non-UI callers fail fast with a headless hint (no browser).
  - `oauth-errors.ts`: typed `OAuthFlowError` (terminal vs transient kinds).
- Wired into existing extension files: `transport.ts` (attach `authProvider`
  to the HTTP transport; inject `OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN` for stdio OAuth),
  `connection.ts` (map `UnauthorizedError`/terminal `OAuthFlowError` →
  `needs_auth` by unwrapping the wrapped connect cause), `service.ts` +
  `service-types.ts` (build the auth plan per server, store it on the
  connection entry, expose `getAuthTarget`/`getPendingAuth`),
  `connection-types.ts` (`authProvider` option), `commands.ts` (auth
  subcommands).

### Why
- Spec §7 requires OAuth 2.1 (PKCE S256, RFC 8707, discovery, headless flows)
  with a 0600 file token store and a cross-process refresh lock so concurrent
  senpi processes never trigger refresh-token-family invalidation.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this alone
- Not applicable — implemented entirely with the SDK + public `pi.*` API; no
  core-tree edits outside `builtin/mcp/`.

### Expected merge conflict zones
- `builtin/mcp/transport.ts` — LOW (added `authProvider` option + stdio env
  injection; additive).
- `builtin/mcp/connection.ts` / `connection-types.ts` — LOW (added optional
  `authProvider` + a needs_auth branch in the connect catch).
- `builtin/mcp/service.ts` / `service-types.ts` — LOW/MEDIUM (auth-plan
  construction in the connection-creation loop + new accessors).
- `builtin/mcp/commands.ts` — LOW (added auth subcommands to the dispatch).
- `builtin/mcp/changes.md` — LOW (union of entries).

## W1 implementation — config, transports, service, tools, commands (2026-07-07)

### What changed
- Filled the 2026-07-06 no-op skeleton (`extensions/changes.md`) with the full
  W1 implementation across `builtin/mcp/`:
  - `config-schema.ts` / `config.ts` / `config-edit.ts`: TypeBox-validated
    `mcpServers` config with discovery and merge across global, project, and
    imported Claude Desktop configs (`settings.importConfigs: ["claude"]`),
    env-var interpolation, per-server enable/disable, and project-trust gating
    (untrusted projects cannot activate project-scoped servers).
  - `transport.ts`: transport factory for `stdio` (spawned command, default
    environment, spec-conformant shutdown, child process reaping via
    `process-tree.ts`) and `http` (StreamableHTTP client transport).
  - `connection.ts`: per-server connection state machine with connect timeouts
    and async error routing through `wrap.ts` guards.
  - `service.ts`: process-owned singleton service that attaches sessions,
    owns server lifecycle (`lazy` / `eager` / `keep-alive`, idle shutdown),
    surfaces connect failures, and refreshes after extension reloads.
  - `expose/`: tool registration end-to-end with spec-correct call semantics
    (`register.ts`, `naming.ts`, `pagination.ts`, `schema-compat.ts`,
    `session.ts`, `status.ts`) plus the exposure policy (`policy.ts`):
    `auto` / `direct` / `search` / `proxy`, `includeTools` / `excludeTools`
    filtering, `directTools`, and the `searchThreshold` cutoff. Inactive tools
    are cleared after policy filtering.
  - `commands.ts` / `status.ts`: the `/mcp` command suite — `status`, `add`,
    `enable` / `disable`, `test`, `logs`, `reconnect` — with tool refresh after
    `add`.
  - `instructions.ts`: MCP server `instructions` are injected into the system
    prompt through `before_agent_start` and refreshed on session start.
  - `log.ts` / `errors.ts` / `wrap.ts`: per-server logging with secret
    redaction (authorization headers, error payloads, wrap fallbacks), an MCP
    error taxonomy, and async wrap utilities so background failures surface
    without leaking secrets.
  - `catalog.ts` / `active-set.ts`: resolved-server catalog and active tool
    set bookkeeping.
- `builtin/index.ts`: the `mcp` entry registered by the skeleton is unchanged
  (kept last so its provider-payload tap observes all co-resident builtin
  mutations).
- Auth: `bearer` (via `bearerTokenEnv`) and `oauth` (authorization-code and
  client-credentials flows, optional `clientMetadataUrl` / `scopes` /
  `oauthCallbackUrl`) per server.

### Senpi design decisions
- MCP is a builtin extension, not core: pi philosophy keeps MCP out of the
  core runtime, and the fork honors that boundary — everything reaches the
  session through `registerTool`, `registerCommand`, and event handlers.
- The service is process-owned (not session-owned) so keep-alive servers and
  their child processes survive session reloads and are reaped exactly once.
- Output guards (`settings.outputGuard`: `maxBytes` / `maxLines` /
  `maxTokens`) bound tool results before they reach the model context.
- Search-based exposure exists to keep large MCP catalogs from flooding the
  tool list; `settings.nativeToolSearch` can defer to provider-native tool
  search where available.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this differently
- Implemented entirely as a builtin extension via the public `pi.*` API
  (`registerTool`, `registerCommand`, `session_start`, `before_agent_start`,
  `session_shutdown`). No change to `extensions/types.ts` or `runner.ts`.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync
- LOW: `builtin/index.ts` import block + `builtinExtensions` array if upstream
  reorders or adds builtins.
- LOW: `packages/coding-agent/package.json` around the exact-pinned
  `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` dependency.
- NONE for `extensions/types.ts` (untouched); `builtin/mcp/` itself does not
  exist upstream.

## Non-blocking reconnect on hot reload (2026-08-20)

### What changed

- The `session_start` handler still starts `attach()` immediately, but when `event.reason === "reload"` it no longer awaits it; errors keep flowing through `wrapAsync` -> the extension error sink. `startup`/omitted reasons await exactly as before.

### Why

- Hot reload awaits every `session_start` handler; MCP reconnect measured ~260ms per reload on the critical path. Attach is single-flight (`attachPromise` + `McpService` attach queue) and `before_agent_start` already awaits `attachPromise`, so tools are still connected before any agent turn needs them.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The handler lives in this builtin; only it can decide not to await its own reconnect.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `index.ts` `session_start` registration block; new `test/suite/mcp-reload-deferral.test.ts`.
