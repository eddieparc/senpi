## 2026-09-30 - Native images on ChatGPT subscriptions

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/openai-image-gen/gate.ts` enables native image generation for `openai-codex-responses` models on the official HTTPS `chatgpt.com` endpoint, honoring an explicit compatibility opt-out.
- Existing payload arbitration replaces the client Images API tool with the native server tool; existing response parsing and file externalization are reused.
- Added subscription endpoint and request-model transition regressions in `test/suite/chatgpt-image-generation.test.ts`.

### Why

- Subscription sessions previously fell through to an unrelated Images API gateway because the native gate accepted only `openai-responses`.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The change is implemented in the existing builtin extension that owns native image-tool arbitration; no core change or second injector is needed.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/openai-image-gen/gate.ts` capability predicate.

## 2026-09-10 - Native tool follows the Sunburst default

### What changed

- No code change here: `inject.ts` pins `model` to `DEFAULT_IMAGE_MODEL`, which moved back to `gpt-image-2.5-sunburst`, so the native `image_generation` server tool now requests the most capable model too.

### Why

- The client tool and the native server tool must not disagree about which model a session gets.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The injected literal is owned by this builtin; a second injector would be stripped by the dedupe pass.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: none in this directory.

## 2026-09-10 - Pin the native image_generation model

### What changed

- `inject.ts`: the injected server tool is `{ type: "image_generation", model: DEFAULT_IMAGE_MODEL }` instead of a bare `{ type: "image_generation" }`; dedupe and strip semantics are unchanged.

### Why

- The OpenAI Responses tool defaults `model` to `gpt-image-1` when omitted, so official-endpoint sessions rendered with a first-generation model while the client tool used 2.5.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The injector is the single owner of the native tool entry; a second injector would be stripped by the dedupe pass.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the single injected literal in `inject.ts`.

# openai-image-gen builtin — changes

## message_end externalization of native image results (2026-08-11)

### What changed

- Added `externalize.ts` and a `message_end` handler in `index.ts`. Every completed `image_generation_call` provider-native block is decoded, written under `<cwd>/generated-images/`, and REPLACED by a normal text block `Generated image: <relative path>` (plus `Revised prompt: <value>` only when the provider sent one). The handler runs for every assistant message regardless of arbitration state, because whichever path produced the bytes they must not reach history.
- The base64 block is removed whether or not the write succeeds: a decode or disk failure yields a short `Generated image could not be saved: <reason>.` text instead. Every per-block failure is caught, so no handler exception can ever leave the payload in the message.
- Filenames: the provider item id when present, else `<responseId>-<outputIndex>`, both run through `sanitizeImageStem`. The extension comes from the decoded magic bytes (png/jpg/webp, default png) because the Responses API does not contractually pin the result encoding.
- Never overwrites: a taken filename gains a `-2`, `-3`, ... suffix, so a replayed or duplicated item id cannot discard a valid earlier image.
- `imagegen/paths.ts` now exports `sanitizeImageStem` and `GENERATED_IMAGE_DIRECTORY`; the tool's `sanitizeToolCallId` delegates to the shared helper so the sanitize rule has one owner. `displayPath` is reused for the relative path in the replacement text.
- Added a specialized `image_generation_call` case to `modes/provider-native-rendering.ts` rendering status, decoded byte count, and revised prompt ONLY.

### Why

- `AssistantMessage` has no image content variant, so a native result can only survive as base64 inside a providerNative block. Session history is persisted from the finalized message, so without this pass a 24 MiB payload would be written to the session file and replayed into every later context.
- `message_end` is the correct seam: replacements preserve the role and are applied in place before `sessionManager.appendMessage(event.message)` runs, so agent state, listeners, and persistence all observe the externalized message.
- The renderer is defense in depth. It shows a byte count rather than the payload and deliberately shows NO path: it only ever receives the pre-replacement block, and the file does not exist until `message_end` runs.

### Why not core

- Disk IO for a provider-specific item type is builtin policy; `packages/ai` stays browser-safe and owns no filesystem access.

### Merge-conflict zones

- LOW: `externalize.ts` is new and owned by this change.
- MEDIUM: `modes/provider-native-rendering.ts` is shared across renderers; preserve sibling subtype cases when resolving conflicts.
- MEDIUM: `imagegen/paths.ts` is imported cross-builtin; keep `sanitizeImageStem`, `GENERATED_IMAGE_DIRECTORY`, and `displayPath` signature-stable.

## Native image_generation injection with arbitration (2026-08-11)

### What changed

- Added the `openai-image-gen` builtin. It injects the OpenAI Responses `image_generation` server tool into provider request payloads and arbitrates it against the sibling imagegen builtin's client-side `generate_image` function tool so exactly one surface is exposed per request.
- `gate.ts` exports the pure `supportsNativeOpenAiImageGeneration(model)` gate plus the `PI_OPENAI_IMAGE_GEN` enable-env parse (default-on, mirroring `openai-web-search`) and the `nativeImageGenModelKey` cache key (`provider|api|baseUrl|id`).
- `inject.ts` enforces mutual exclusion at the wire level: native entries are always stripped first, the client function tool is matched by `tool.name === "generate_image"` (faux/extension payloads may omit `type`), and exactly one `{ type: "image_generation" }` is appended in native mode. A no-op returns the ORIGINAL payload reference because payload hooks chain replacements.
- `index.ts` owns the arbitration state machine `{ kind: "native" | "client" | "unavailable", modelKey, source?, reason? }`: refreshed on `session_start` (ctx.model) and `model_select` (event.model), and refreshed inside `before_provider_request` whenever the observed request model's key differs from the cached one. `before_agent_start` appends a short native section only while native-active.
- Cross-builtin wiring per the websearch precedent: this builtin imports `resolveImageGenAuth` and the registry-override seam from `imagegen`, and calls `setNativeBypass` in `imagegen/state.ts` on every refresh (both flip directions), so the client tool defers only while the server tool will actually be injected for the current model. `session_shutdown` clears the bypass.
- Registered the factory in the builtin catalog immediately after `imagegen`.

### Why

- The client tool and the server tool must never be offered together: the model would pick one arbitrarily and the other path's result handling would never run. Arbitration happens at the payload layer, never via `setActiveTools`, so tool registration stays stable for renderers and permissions.
- Divergence from the websearch gate: `azure-openai-responses` defaults to FALSE here. Azure serves image generation as a separate deployment, not as a Responses server tool, so azure endpoints opt in only through an explicit `compat.supportsImageGeneration`. Proxied `openai-responses` endpoints keep the websearch lesson and default to the client tool, because a translating gateway rejects tool types it never implemented.
- The in-hook model-key refresh exists because payload hooks observe the effective request model, which can differ from the last lifecycle-cached model (fallback routing, per-request resolution); a stale decision must never reach the wire.

### Why not core

- Image-surface arbitration is builtin policy. Core owns payload hook chaining and model lifecycle events; the imagegen/openai-image-gen pair owns which image tool a given model may see.

### Test seam note

- `test/suite/generate-image-extension.test.ts` drives both builtins through the real session harness: model switches go through `session.setModel`, payload capture goes through `ExtensionRunner.emitBeforeProviderRequest` (whose optional request-model argument exercises the in-hook staleness refresh), and the credential direction is forced with `setImageGenRegistry` because the ambient builtin catalog is never credential-free.

### Merge-conflict zones

- LOW: `gate.ts`, `inject.ts`, `index.ts`, and this file are new isolated modules owned by this change.
- MEDIUM: `builtin/index.ts` is a shared catalog; preserve sibling registrations and the ordering comment when resolving conflicts.
- MEDIUM: `imagegen/state.ts` and `imagegen/auth.ts` are imported cross-builtin; keep their exported seams (`setNativeBypass`, `imageGenRegistryOverride`, `resolveImageGenAuth`) signature-stable.
