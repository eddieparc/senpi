# goal Extension Changes

## 2026-10-09 - Cover live stale stops and explain them to the model (senpi#3053)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/regressions/3026-stale-goal-accounting.test.ts`: active work accrues through the real extension, stale admission fires during that session, and subsequent `sendUserMessage` and `sendMessage({ triggerTurn: true })` turns retain the committed tokens/time. Both cases pass unchanged production at ca49caf25f and fail if `syncContinuationGoal` no longer clears the stopped accounting window.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/format.ts`: model tool JSON includes a `continuation` object for stale-stopped goals, with stable `status: "stale_stopped"` and a neutral explanation of stale progress and user-message or `/goal resume` recovery. Human-readable status formatting remains separate.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/types.ts`: declares the model-facing continuation object without changing persisted state, UI snapshots, or app-server protocol.
- `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/regressions/3026-stale-goal-model-output.test.ts`: inspects the registered `get_goal` result's parsed status token and structured message, with active, paused, and completed controls. It does not pin explanation prose.

### Why

The earlier accounting tests started with a goal already stopped on disk and did not guard retirement of an existing live window. The model's paused snapshot also lacked an explicit stale-stop cause and recovery explanation.

### Why an extension could not handle it

The builtin owns live accounting synchronization and the goal tool response consumed by the model.

### Expected merge conflict zones

`format.ts` model response construction, `types.ts` response shape, and the two regression files. Keep UI labels, paused snapshots, persistent active-plus-marker state, and the accounting guards intact.

## 2026-10-09 - Pin stopped accounting and show paused-style stale status (senpi#3026)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/index.ts`: documents the lead's don't-count rule at accounting admission. Stale-stopped non-user-input turns remain excluded; active turns still accrue their assistant tokens and time. The existing one-shot stale-stop/reopen notice and no-auto-restart behavior remain intact.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/types.ts`: adds a shared display-status projection and the optional stop checkpoint to tool snapshots; the stored status and accounting fields do not change.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/ui.ts`: stale-stopped goals use the paused rendering branch and read `Goal stopped: no progress (send a message or /goal resume)` without a pursuit timer.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/format.ts`: `/goal` labels the stop; tool snapshots project paused status and preserve the checkpoint for client/rendering consumers.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/renderers.ts`: stopped cards use the paused glyph/color and recovery label through details and JSON fallback. Normal goal cards and committed usage totals remain unchanged.
- `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/regressions/3026-stale-goal-accounting.test.ts`: real extension `sendUserMessage` and trigger-turn delivery tests pin current behavior in both directions; opening a stale window in a mutant fails both stopped cases.
- `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/regressions/3026-stale-goal-status.test.ts`: failing-first coverage for the footer, `/goal`, light/dark cards, JSON snapshots, and app-server projection.

### Why

The lead decided that a stopped goal does not accrue background-turn usage and must look stopped, not actively pursued. A stale-stop marker previously froze usage while every display still said active or pursuing.

### Why an extension could not handle it

The builtin owns accounting admission, goal-tool snapshots, and the footer/card rendering paths.

### Expected merge conflict zones

`index.ts` accounting admission; `types.ts` tool snapshot shape; `format.ts`, `ui.ts`, and `renderers.ts` status formatting. Preserve internal active-plus-marker state and accepted-input/resume recovery. The historical notice entry below predates the lead's accounting decision.

## 2026-10-09 - Explain stale goal recovery at stop and reopen (senpi#3026)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/lifecycle-helpers.ts`: a claimed stale denial emits one informational recovery notice before best-effort stop publication; repeated denial probes do not repeat it.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/index.ts`: startup and resume show the same notice for a stale-stopped active goal. Extension reload and rendering do not show it, and reopening never restarts the goal.
- `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/regressions/3026-stale-goal-notice.test.ts`: covers stop deduplication, startup/resume, reload and state controls, and two separate reopens.
- `packages/coding-agent/docs/session-format.md`: documents the recovery notice and client elapsed-time calculation from committed time plus the last usage checkpoint.

### Why

Stale stops persisted without telling the user how to continue. Usage-accounting policy remains unchanged pending the lead's product decision.

### Why an extension could not handle it

The builtin owns the locked stale-stop claim and session-open admission.

### Expected merge conflict zones

`lifecycle-helpers.ts` denial side effects and `index.ts` session-start handler. Keep notice emission outside rendering and reload paths, retain locked-claim deduplication, and preserve no-auto-restart admission.

## 2026-10-09 - Failed stop publication cannot skip lifecycle cleanup (senpi#3014)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/lifecycle-helpers.ts`: independently catch and warn on both additive stop-entry appends, including the engine-pause history lookup, then return the persisted stop decision. Capture the session logger before the asynchronous claim so reporting a retired-context failure does not read that context again.
- Lifecycle regressions drive stale and cap denials through the real agent-end handler, its UI/timer synchronization, the todo backstop and shutdown. A failed first append still attempts the second entry.

### Why

An append failure escaped after the goal file was stopped, skipping the caller's cleanup. A stale goal accrued another 600 seconds at shutdown, and blocking guards skipped UI synchronization and the todo backstop.

### Why an extension could not handle it

The builtin owns the persisted stop decision and must return it even when additive publication fails.

### Expected merge conflict zones

`lifecycle-helpers.ts` denial publication and logger import. Preserve independent best-effort writes and the return of the persisted goal.

## 2026-10-09 - Guard side effects precede additive stop publication (senpi#3007, senpi#3014)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/lifecycle-helpers.ts`: after claiming and persisting a blocking denial, deliver the existing warning and `goal_continuation_guard_tripped` event before appending the additive stop entries.
- The delayed-monitor cap regression now checks the blocked reason, guard payload and stopped-entry payload together, including a missing entry writer and a writer whose publication throws after append.

### Why

The new append ran before the existing guard side effects. A missing writer in the delayed-monitor fixture, or a failing entry publication in a real session, threw after the goal was blocked but prevented the guard notification and event.

### Why an extension could not handle it

The builtin's shared denial handler owns both the guard side effects and the additive stop entries.

### Expected merge conflict zones

`lifecycle-helpers.ts` denial handling. Preserve the locked claim and publish the existing guard side effects before the additive entry writes.

## 2026-10-09 - Durable continuation stop decisions and frozen stale accounting (senpi#3007)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/lifecycle-helpers.ts`: every active-goal guard denial except eligibility/single-flight appends `goal-continuation-stopped` after a durable stop claim, with `engine-paused` for stale (`goal-stale`) and output repetition (`goal-repeat`).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/continuation.ts`: a claimed stop is ineligible on session-start until reset, so reopening or rebuilding the extension cannot silently restart a stale goal. A later real turn can still trip a blocking guard.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/store.ts`: claims a denial under the goal-file lock, closes the stale measurement tail, advances the measurement checkpoint when usage is committed, and resets the claim on accepted input, explicit resume, or continuation delivery. Blocking guards retain the existing status-transition counter reset.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/types.ts` and `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/persistence.ts`: optional sanitized `continuationStoppedAt` persists the claim across retries and reopen.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/index.ts` and `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/elapsed-ticker.ts`: stopped active goals retire live accounting and freeze elapsed time; the queue path synchronizes a changed goal even when its status remains active.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/direct-input-lifecycle.ts`: accepted input starts accounting again after resetting the stopped goal.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/monitor-continuation.ts`: a stale or overflow denial on the accepted-user-turn path reaches the same denial handler instead of returning silently.

### Why

Stale continuation denials left active goals with an open measurement window and no durable signal, so idle clients displayed an ever-growing pursuit timer.

### Why an extension could not handle it

This builtin owns admission, persisted goal state, and its accounting window.

### Expected merge conflict zones

Goal store mutations, denial admission, direct-input reset, and accounting/UI synchronization. Preserve the locked claim and measurement checkpoint together to avoid duplicate entries or elapsed double-counting.

## 2026-10-06 - A GPT-6 Astra receiver gets the goal contract without the completion audit (senpi#2796)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/prompt.ts`: `buildContinuationPrompt(goal, { modelId })` renders a shorter prompt when the receiver is `gpt-6-astra` or `gpt-6-astra-fast` (a provider prefix is tolerated; `isGpt6AstraReceiver`): the untrusted objective, the four legal turn endings, and the blocked floor `update_goal` enforces. The completion audit, the no-progress check, and the usage lines are not rendered for that receiver. Every other model id, and an undefined one, renders exactly the previous prompt.
- `lifecycle-helpers.ts` and `monitor-continuation.ts`: the two continuation call sites pass `ctx.model?.id`.
- `test/suite/goal-modules.test.ts`: the Astra receiver drops the audit and stays under half the default length while keeping the contract lines; Sol, 6.1 Sol, Luna, Claude, Kimi, a near-miss id, and `undefined` render `toBe` the unpinned prompt.

### Why

- The audit's "uncertainty means not achieved - gather stronger evidence" line is unpassable for a model whose prior is already to verify broadly; on a 12-hour session it was injected 46 times and every wake added a gate to the todo list. Other models were not observed doing this, so they keep the audit.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The continuation prompt is built inside this builtin's wake path.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `prompt.ts`: the top of the file and the new function after `buildContinuationPrompt`; the two `buildContinuationPrompt(goal` call sites.

## 2026-10-05 - Record the actual wake trigger and label cache accounting (senpi#2778)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/monitor-continuation.ts` and `cache-warm.ts`: resumed events and entries record `wakeCause` (`timer` or `sources-drained`) and the original planned `dueAtMs`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/cache-warm-renderer.ts`: early source drains and timer backstops have distinct explanations. Old entries without a cause say it was not recorded. Cache figures are labeled cumulative prior-turn accounting, the discount is conditional on reuse, and the next cache hit is explicitly unverified.

### Why

- A source draining before its backstop was labeled a scheduled wake. Aggregated request usage was presented as tokens that had stayed warm, although no provider request had verified reuse.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- This builtin owns the timer/drain distinction, durable wait entries, and their renderer.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `monitor-continuation.ts`: resumed payload construction; `cache-warm.ts`: durable entry type; `cache-warm-renderer.ts`: wake explanation and cache line.

## 2026-10-02 - Stale-context detection recognizes a reload retirement (senpi#2549)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/stale-context.ts`: `isStaleExtensionContextError` also matches `STALE_EXTENSION_GENERATION_AFTER_RELOAD_MESSAGE` ("stale extension generation after reload"), the message `AgentSession.reload()` retires the old generation with. The runner keeps the first retirement message, so a context retired by a reload never carries the replacement prefix the check looked for.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/elapsed-ticker.ts` and `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/wait-ticker.ts`: `sync()` returns without arming the interval when its immediate render hit a retired ctx (the tick already cleared `ctx`), instead of leaving an inert interval running until the next `stop()`. The next live `sync()` arms it.
- Tests (`packages/coding-agent/test/suite/regressions/2549-stale-context-detection.test.ts`): the check recognizes the errors a context retired by a real harness reload and by a real dispose throw, rejects unrelated errors, `GoalElapsedTicker` retires on the reload error, and neither goal ticker arms an interval for a sync whose first render is stale, while the next live sync does.

### Why

- On main the reload error was not recognized, so `GoalElapsedTicker`, `GoalWaitTicker`, the monitor continuation and stop lifecycle (#1028) rethrew it from their timer callbacks, and the monitor footer ticker fixed for senpi#2549 shares this check.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The check is the goal builtin's own helper, shared by the terminal builtin's ticker.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `stale-context.ts`. Fork-only surface.

## 2026-10-01 - The no-goal todo reminder names when a goal is worth registering (senpi#2505)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/todo-gate.ts` `staleGoalTodoReminder`: the fix line is "Register one with create_goal only when the work must outlive this turn - it waits on external state or needs more than one verify-and-fix round" (the stale-goal variant adds that a new goal archives the completed one), and the closing line is "Otherwise continue without a goal." The old text ("If this todo list tracks a durable objective (multi-step work that should survive across turns), register it now with create_goal so progress is tracked and audited. ... If the todos are trivial short-lived bookkeeping for the current turn, continue without a goal.") asked the model to classify its own list, and GPT-6 Astra registered a goal for a single-turn status question. `test/suite/goal-todo-stale-reminder.test.ts` is unchanged (it asserts the no-goal and stale-goal lines and `undefined` for live goals).

### Why

- The reminder is a decision rule now, the same one the `create_goal` tool description already states, so a single-turn request stops picking up a goal, a completion audit and an `update_goal` call.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- This is the goal builtin's own reminder text.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `todo-gate.ts` `staleGoalTodoReminder`.

## 2026-10-01 - Goal mutations are atomic across processes (senpi#2499)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/goal-file-lock.ts` (new): `withGoalFileLock(ref, fn)` runs `fn` inside the existing in-process `serializeByKey` tail and, inside that, holds a proper-lockfile lock for the whole read-modify-write, using the lockfile-policy backoff (100ms..1s) and `isLockError`. `GOAL_LOCK_OPTIONS` (`stale: 10s`, `update: 2s`, `realpath: false`) is shared by every goal-lock contender: a goal RMW takes milliseconds, so a live holder is never seen as stale, while a holder killed mid-mutation is reclaimed within ~10s. `GOAL_LOCK_WAIT_BUDGET_MS` (15s) exceeds the stale window, so waiters ride through a crashed holder; only an exhausted budget throws `GoalStoreBusyError`. `fn` receives `HeldGoalLock`: `write(goal)` and `assertHeld()` throw `GoalStoreLockCompromisedError` right before a write once the lock was reclaimed. The lock directory is `.goal-lock-<sha256(basename)[:40]>` beside the goal file (`goalLockFilePath`), because the default `<file>.lock` overflows NAME_MAX for a goal basename already at 255 bytes. Only the parent directory is created before locking, never a placeholder goal file, so a pending legacy import still runs.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/store.ts`: `writeGoal`, `createGoal`, `updateGoal`, `clearGoal`, `accountGoalUsage`, `recordContinuationDelivered`, and `resetContinuationStreak` run under `withGoalFileLock` and write through `held.write`, with `held.assertHeld()` before the history and full-objective side writes. New `migrateLegacyGoal(ref)` runs `migrateLegacyGoalFile` under the same lock.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/index.ts`: `session_start` calls `migrateLegacyGoal` instead of `migrateLegacyGoalFile`, so a concurrent mutation in another process cannot overwrite a freshly imported legacy goal.

### Why

- `serializeByKey` is an in-process `Map` of promise tails, so two processes holding the same session (shared session holders, a TUI plus a desktop or daemon host, a `PI_GOAL_STORE_FILE` child) interleaved read-modify-write cycles: two processes x 300 usage updates kept 303 of 600, and a completion in one process was reverted to `active` by the other.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Goal is a manually ported builtin (`MANUAL_PACKAGES` in `scripts/sync-builtin-extensions.mjs`); its store is maintained here.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the import block, each mutation's `withGoalFileLock(ref, async (held) => ...)` opening and `held.write` call in `store.ts`, and the `session_start` migration call in `index.ts`. An upstream pi-goal sync that restores `serializeByKey(goalFilePath(ref), ...)` or direct `writeGoalFile` calls must keep the cross-process lock and the guarded write.

## 2026-09-30 - Drop test-only goal exports (senpi#2447)

### What changed

- `prompt.ts`: removed `buildMonitorStallNotice`, a one-line wrapper over `buildGoalStallNotice(n, { liveSources: ["terminal-monitors"] })` that only a test called. The earlier entry describing it is historical.
- `continuation.ts`: removed `shouldQueueGoalContinuationWhenIdle` and `shouldQueueGoalContinuationAfterAgentEnd`. Neither had a production caller; production gates through `evaluateGoalContinuation` and `didAgentEndCleanly`, whose message-shape rows the suite now asserts directly.

### Why

- The exports existed only to be tested. The verdict suite (`goal-continuation-verdict.test.ts`) owns the status, pending and idle gating at the production entry.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Goal is a manually ported builtin (`MANUAL_PACKAGES` in `scripts/sync-builtin-extensions.mjs`), so its source is maintained here.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the tail of `prompt.ts` and the predicate block above `didAgentEndCleanly` in `continuation.ts`. An upstream pi-goal sync that re-adds them can drop them again.

## 2026-09-28 - Terminal provider 401/403 blocks the goal on the first hit (senpi#2293)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/terminal-provider-error.ts`: `terminalProviderAuthFailure(event)` returns `{ httpStatus: 401 | 403, provider, model }` when the turn ends with an error, `willRetry: false`, and no system-owned abort. It reads the adapter's `providerDiagnostic` first (`httpStatus` 401/403, or category `auth`); only when the message carries no diagnostic does it fall back to a leading `401`/`403` in `errorMessage`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/continuation-recovery.ts`: `PROVIDER_AUTH_BLOCKED_REASON_PREFIX`, `providerAuthBlockedReason`, and `providerAuthRecoveryHint` (names `provider/model`, `/login <provider>`, the key/token for 401 or the model's plan access for 403 (the Copilot plan for `github-copilot`), and any proxy or gateway). `isMechanicalContinuationBlock` treats reasons with the prefix as mechanical.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/agent-end-continuation.ts`: an active goal whose turn ended with a terminal 401/403 is blocked before the system-abort and provider-recovery routing, with one warning notice.

### Why

Since 2026-08-24, terminal provider errors queue a guarded `providerRecovery` continuation. A rejected credential or a model the account cannot use fails identically on every continuation, so the goal burned all 8 continuations and ended with `continuation cap reached. Send any message to resume.`; the next message looped again. Reported on GitHub Copilot with kimi-k3, whose endpoint answered 403 with an empty body.

### Why an extension could not handle it

Agent-end routing, goal blocking, and the mechanical-block set are private to the goal builtin.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW in `agent-end-continuation.ts` (the block after the policy-rejection check), `terminal-provider-error.ts` (new export), `continuation-recovery.ts` (`isMechanicalContinuationBlock`).

## 2026-09-25 - Turn-end todo-owed backstop for main sessions without an active goal (senpi#2121)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/todo-owed-backstop.ts` (new): `TodoOwedBackstop` evaluates at the tail of the `agent_end` handler, after `continueGoalAfterAgentEnd` returned. A turn owes a nudge only when every clause holds: main session (`ctx.sessionManager.getHeader()?.parentSession === undefined` and `ctx.mode` not in `{print, json}` - the set `terminal/notify.ts` never wakes; child sessions are untagged today, so they pass and are treated as main), `event.aborted !== true` and `didAgentEndCleanly(event.messages)` with a last stopReason other than `length`, no pending messages, no active goal, no continuation pending, at least one open todo task (`todo-gate.ts openTodoTaskContents`), no live wake source (`monitor-continuation.ts hasActiveWakeSources`), no `ask_user_question` / `request_user_input` tool call in the run's messages, a final paragraph that does not end a sentence with `?`, and `todo.turnEndBackstop` enabled. Delivery is a hidden followUp exactly like `queueHiddenGoalPrompt` (`pi.sendMessage({ customType: "senpi.todo-owed", content, display: false }, { triggerTurn: true, deliverAs: "followUp" })`) with the Ask/Now/Next anchors from `todotools/state.ts getLatestTodoStateFromBranchEntries` + `describeAskNowNext`; the second delivery prefixes "Second and final reminder. ". After two, `ctx.ui.notify("Agent stopped with N open todo tasks (Now: ...). Send a message to continue.", "warning")` fires once per chain, then nothing. `todo_owed_reminder` is emitted per delivery/cap; every suppression logs one debug line naming the first failing clause. No timers anywhere.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/index.ts`: instantiates the backstop, resets its chain on `session_start` and `session_tree`, and calls `afterAgentEnd` at the tail of the `agent_end` handler.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/direct-input-lifecycle.ts`: optional `onAcceptedDirectInput` dependency, fired for every accepted non-extension input; the goal builtin wires it to reset the backstop chain.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/continuation.ts`: `didAgentEndCleanly` is now exported (the backstop reuses the goal's own clean-end predicate instead of restating it).

### Why

A text-only end of turn with open todo work and no question stops an unattended run mid-task. The Anthropic Opus 5.5 guide ("Unattended agentic runs") prescribes exactly this harness shape: name the open items in a short user message and stop after two or three automatic continuations. The goal path already owns the turn end when a goal is active; this backstop covers only the gap where nothing does.

### Why an extension could not handle it

The predicate needs the goal builtin's own continuation state (clean-end predicate, continuation latch, wake sources, direct-input lifecycle); a foreign extension cannot see any of it.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW in `index.ts` (tail of the `agent_end` handler, the `session_start` reset), `direct-input-lifecycle.ts` (dis injection), `continuation.ts` (the `export` keyword).

## 2026-09-24 - Sync with pi-goal 0.3.1 (senpi#2079)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/prompt.ts`: the continuation prompt calls the objective "untrusted goal data" instead of "user-provided data" (pi-goal#4). The rest of senpi's continuation guidance is unchanged.
- Not ported: pi-goal 0.3.1 removes the blocked -> active auto-resume on every user prompt. senpi never had that path: `direct-input-lifecycle.ts` reactivates a goal on accepted direct input only for mechanical continuation blocks (`isMechanicalContinuationBlock`), so user-interrupt and model-declared blocks already stay blocked until `/goal resume`.
- The sync report's remaining hunks are whole-file differences between upstream's smaller module set and senpi's extended one; applying them would revert senpi-only behavior, so they were not applied.

### Why

`create_goal` can store an objective the model inferred, so calling it user-provided overstated its authority in every hidden continuation turn.

### Why an extension could not handle it

The continuation prompt is built inside this builtin.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW in `prompt.ts` first objective sentence.

## 2026-09-23 - One cache-warm card per wait; reloads keep the parked wait (senpi#2051)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/parked-wait.ts` (new): `findParkedGoalWait(branch, goalId)` reads the pending wait (last `goal-cache-warmup` entry is a `scheduled` one for this goal, no message after it).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/monitor-continuation.ts`: `rearmMonitorBackstop` passes the parked wait to `#schedule`, which then keeps its iteration, cache snapshot, delay and original `dueAtMs` (timer armed for the remaining time), re-emits `goal_continuation_scheduled` for live consumers, and appends no entry.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/cache-warm-renderer.ts` + `index.ts`: `isSameGoalCacheWarmCard` registered as the renderer's `replaces` option, so a same-goal entry directly after the previous card updates it in place.

### Why

- A config reload re-armed the backstop through a fresh generation: a new iteration-1 entry without cache figures and a full backstop from the reload time, which can land after the prompt-cache TTL. Three stacked cards were observed for one wait.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Goal-owned logic; documented here by convention (fork-only directory).

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `#schedule` and `rearmMonitorBackstop` in `monitor-continuation.ts`.

## 2026-09-22 - claude-sdk-oauth provider id renamed to anthropic-subscription in the exhaustion classifier comment (senpi#1989)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/terminal-provider-error.ts`: doc comment names the `anthropic-subscription` account-rotating proxy. The classifier itself compares `message.api !== "claude-sdk-oauth"`, which is the FROZEN wire api id (see the api-id split entry in `builtin/anthropic-subscription/changes.md`) and stays byte-identical.

### Why

Comment accuracy after the provider-id rename; the wire api id does not move, so the classifier keeps matching messages from the renamed provider.

### Why an extension could not handle it

Terminal-provider-error classification is goal-extension core logic; nothing for another extension to override.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `terminal-provider-error.ts` comment block, against classifier changes.

## 2026-09-20 - Resume blocked goals on manual continue (#1871)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/index.ts` resumes a blocked goal when a `manual-continue` custom message starts. The user-authorized transition clears blocked metadata and continuation counters, restarts accounting, and refreshes the goal UI without queuing another turn.
- Regression coverage drives idle, steering, and follow-up dot submissions through `AgentSession`, including model, user-interrupt, and provider blocks. Paused/completed goals, ordinary input, image submissions, unrelated custom messages, and sessions without goals retain their behavior.

### Why

- The dot shortcut bypasses ordinary input events, so the direct-input lifecycle never saw the user's request to continue. The conversation resumed while its goal remained blocked.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- This is implemented in the existing goal extension using its message lifecycle hook. No core or public extension API change is needed.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/index.ts`: imports and message lifecycle handlers.

## 2026-09-13 - Park on the earliest authoritative question deadline (senpi#1645)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/channel-state-subscriptions.ts` forwards the full wake-source event. `monitor-continuation.ts` takes the minimum supplied ask-user item deadline instead of inferring every request's deadline from the settings window.
- A changed minimum reparks an already scheduled monitor timer, including while direct input holds it. Progress retains the same cache-warm iteration and does not append another transcript row. The settings heuristic remains for count-only events; the clamp, past-deadline extra window and last-source drain rule are unchanged. This supersedes the metadata-free behavior described in the 2026-09-10 park entry below.
- The real ask-user/goal integration world now supports multiple request IDs, independent request timeouts and UI progress. Tests cover 30m/5m ordering, settlement recomputation, progress extension, and no repeated warmup transcript entries.

### Why

- Multiple pending requests can have different idle deadlines, and typing extends one request without changing the pending count. The parked timer must follow the current minimum without introducing a periodic prompt or a transcript row per keystroke.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/monitor-continuation.ts` owns the single timer, direct-input holds and admission checks. Event consumers cannot reschedule it from outside the coordinator.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/monitor-continuation.ts`: schedule, noteAskUserWait and setWakeSourceCount; `channel-state-subscriptions.ts`: callback signature and wake-event forwarding. No prompt or backstop-bound constants change.

## Blocked is earned, not asserted: live-channel and goal-turn guards (2026-09-11)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/blocked-audit.ts` (new): `GOAL_BLOCKED_MIN_GOAL_TURNS = 3`, `goalTurnsSinceActivation(entries, goal)` (the calling turn plus every goal-continuation entry delivered since `lastStartedAt`, restarting at the last real user message), and the two rejection messages the model reads.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/tool-registration.ts`: `update_goal` with status `blocked` now runs `assertBlockedAuditIsEarned` before the transition. It throws while any live resumption channel can still deliver (naming the channels) and while the goal has spent fewer than three goal turns on the blocker. `complete` is untouched. The `update_goal` description states both rejections and that retries themselves are unbounded; the `create_goal` description replaces "only when explicitly requested ... do not infer goals from ordinary tasks" with the decision rule the harness already nudges through `staleGoalTodoReminder` (register a goal for work that outlives the turn: it waits on external state, or the requested outcome needs more than one verify-and-fix round).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/monitor-continuation.ts`: `liveWakeSources()` exposes the live channel kinds the private snapshot already tracked; `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/index.ts` passes it to `registerGoalTools`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/prompt.ts`: the blocked audit is restructured as codex's no-progress check plus a three-condition audit. New: progress is defined against status restatements, plans, hypotheses, and untaken next steps; retries are declared unbounded with a widen-the-source rule; the pre-threshold ending is stated positively (say the blocker once, take the next available action, leave the goal active). The recurrence bullet now names the goal-turn floor the tool enforces instead of self-counted "materially different attempts". The completion audit gains the scope-match rule ("a narrow check never supports a broad claim") and "the audit has to prove completion; failing to find remaining work is not proof", each replacing the weaker line in place.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/todo-gate.ts`: the open-todo rejection no longer says "finish each task and mark it done"; it asks for the remaining work or an honest drop and names closing an unfinished task as a false completion.
- Tests: `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/goal-blocked-guards.test.ts` (new: turn counting, both rejections, the accepted block, the user-message restart, and completion staying ungated), `goal-prompt-question-routing.test.ts` and `prompt-single-home.test.ts` updated. RED captured on the test-only commit `47e808925` (3 failed / 5 passed, each failure "promise resolved instead of rejecting"); GREEN after the guards.

### Why

- Blocked was the only stop the model could declare unilaterally, and it was certified in prose. Across 703 sessions since 2026-09-04 (16,688 turns) GPT-6 Astra called `update_goal(blocked)` 24 times against 3 for claude-fable and 5 for claude-opus. In one session both blocked calls landed on the second goal turn of a run, each claiming three exhausted paths, while the data called missing sat in a KV namespace the model had not read; the same session had already reported a completion verified by one probe of a different model than the user's. The two conditions a harness can check - a channel that can still deliver, and turns actually spent on this blocker - move that judgment out of prose. Codex states the same three-turn rule in `ext/goal/templates/goals/continuation.md` and its `update_goal` schema but enforces neither; senpi can, because continuations are session entries.
- The floor is a floor, never a cap: nothing here limits attempts, and both messages say so. This matches the owner's standing instruction that a goal is not to be terminated as blocked while any executable path remains.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The builtin owns the goal tools, the wake-source registry, and the continuation prompt. Only it can reject its own status transition or count the continuations it delivered.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `prompt.ts` audits and `tool-registration.ts` descriptions are edited often; `index.ts` `registerGoalTools` dependency object gains one field.

## 2026-09-09 - Stop automatic goal recovery after terminal policy rejection (#1520)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/terminal-provider-error.ts`: distinguish terminal classifier refusals/sensitive stops and the Codex safety-block error diagnostic from infrastructure failures, only after the explicit retry owner reports `willRetry: false`. The unstructured Codex diagnostic carries no policy code, so it is trusted only on `api === "openai-codex-responses"`; another provider or gateway emitting the same sentence keeps the existing provider/system recovery path. Structured classifier refusals stay provider-independent because they carry their own policy details.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/agent-end-continuation.ts`: persist the active goal as blocked before recovery routing and synchronize the monitor to clear staged recoveries and armed timers. The goal identity/objective survive; no continuation is delivered or counted. This is not a mechanical block that unrelated input automatically resumes.
- `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/goal-policy-rejection.test.ts`: the identity gate is a literal copy of an id owned by `packages/ai`, so the suite drives the same lifecycle once per api id in the shipped Codex catalog (`CHATGPT_SUBSCRIPTION_MODELS`). Renaming that api fails the suite instead of silently disarming the guard while the hardcoded cases stay green.

### Why

- `db6069f83` intentionally kept goals active after infrastructure retry exhaustion. Policy rejection was missing from that distinction, so settlement queued up to eight hidden follow-ups to an already rejected request. Non-policy provider/system recovery and explicit retry ownership remain unchanged.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The builtin owns goal recovery routing, persistence, timers, and settlement admission. An external extension cannot veto its queued continuation.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `agent-end-continuation.ts` routing/imports and `terminal-provider-error.ts` predicates.

## 2026-09-10 - Route user-only blockers through the question tool

### What changed

- `prompt.ts`: goal continuation now names the question tool as a fifth legal ending, asks user-only blockers before the blocked audit, counts materially different attempts, and routes stall notices to questions.
- `tool-registration.ts`: `update_goal` tells the model that a missing user decision is a question, not a blocked status, until the user fails to answer.

### Why

- A goal can be blocked by information only the user can provide; routing that case through the question tool preserves progress and makes the wait explicit.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The goal continuation prompt and `update_goal` tool description define the model-facing goal protocol and must be changed at their source.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `prompt.ts` continuation and stall guidance; `tool-registration.ts` update description.

## 2026-09-10 - Park the continuation on a pending ask-user question

### What changed

- `monitor-continuation.ts`: the coordinator tracks the `ask-user` wake source the ask-user extension publishes while an async question is pending (`WAKE_SOURCE_STATE_EVENT{source:"ask-user"}`). While that source is live, `#schedule` arms ONE `monitor` timer at the question's idle deadline instead of the periodic backstop, so no continuation prompt reaches the model while the user is deciding. The deadline is recorded when the source count rises (a newly asked question restarts the window) from `ctx.getAskUserSettings().timeoutMinutes` (default 30), cleared when the count reaches zero, and clamped through `resolveGoalMonitorContinuationDelayMs` so a misconfigured setting cannot park the goal past the monitor's [1s, 1h] bounds. A deadline that has already passed - the extension restarts its idle timer whenever the user interacts - parks for one more window rather than reverting to the backstop.
- Answer and timeout both drop the wake source, so the existing drain fire (1s after the last source reaches zero) resumes the goal exactly once; the deadline timer is only the backstop for a question whose source never drains.
- `prompt.ts`: `buildGoalStallNotice` gains one ask-user line ("A question to the user is pending; wait for the answer or the timeout, do not ask it again, and do not treat the wait as a stall.") and excludes `ask-user` from the generic "inspect the live channel / stop or replace it" fallback, which is wrong advice for a question only the user can resolve.
- `test/suite/goal-wake-sources.test.ts`, `test/suite/goal-monitor-continuation.test.ts`: cover the park (no prompt before the 30m deadline with the 270s backstop configured, one prompt at the deadline), the single drain wake, the stall-notice line, and the regression that a turn still awaiting a tool result queues no continuation.

### Why

- An async question keeps the turn's work open while the user decides. The 270s backstop would re-prompt the main model roughly every 4m30s for the whole 30-minute answer window - full-context turns the model cannot act on, and the same wait would eventually be read as a stall and audited as blocked. Parking on the question's own deadline keeps exactly one wake: the answer (drain fire) or the timeout.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The wake-source ledger, the single-flight timer and the admission verdict live inside the built-in goal continuation coordinator; no extension hook can observe or replace that timer. The stall notice is built by the same package.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW in `monitor-continuation.ts` around `#schedule`'s delay selection and `#setWakeSourceCount`.
- MEDIUM in `prompt.ts`: todo 14 of the same plan edits `buildContinuationPrompt` and the closing lines of `buildGoalStallNotice`; this change only adds the ask-user advice bullet and the fallback exclusion.

## 2026-09-08 - Recover malformed empty tool-use turns

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/continuation.ts`: distinguish `toolUse` assistant turns with no tool-call blocks from intentional tool termination and admit only the malformed case on immediate continuation.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/agent-end-continuation.ts`: route malformed empty tool-use turns through `providerRecovery`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/monitor-continuation.ts` and `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/lifecycle-helpers.ts`: populate the malformed-turn fact in every verdict input.
- `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/goal-continuation-verdict.test.ts`: cover malformed and intentional tool-use verdicts.

### Why

- A provider can emit `toolUse` without any tool-call block. Nothing executed, so treating it as a deliberate terminating tool leaves an active goal permanently stalled.

### Why an extension could not handle this

- The built-in goal extension owns agent-end admission and its recovery routing.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: continuation eligibility and agent-end verdict-input construction.

## 2026-09-08 - The monitor backstop is a periodic re-check again, default 270s

### What changed

- `cache-warm.ts`: `GOAL_MONITOR_BACKSTOP_DEFAULT_DELAY_MS` is 270_000 (the 5m Anthropic prompt-cache TTL minus the 30s safety buffer) instead of 3_570_000. `resolveGoalMonitorContinuationDelayMs` is otherwise unchanged: it still takes only `goalBackstopMaxSeconds`, never the prompt-cache safe wait, and clamps into [1s, 1h].
- `monitor-continuation.ts`: no code change; the `#schedule` comment now describes the backstop as the periodic re-check floor under the drain fire.
- The mirrors of the default moved with it: `core/settings-manager.ts` `getPromptCacheGoalBackstopMaxSeconds()` (270), `core/settings-shapes.ts`, `core/extensions/runner.ts`, and the fake contexts in `test/suite/goal-monitor-test-harness.ts` and `test/suite/goal-ticker-stale-context.test.ts`.
- `cache-keepalive/index.ts`: comment only; the loop stays decoupled from the goal timer because the configured backstop may still sit past the TTL.

### Why

- A wake source can be misconfigured - a monitor filter that never matches, a stream that never ends, a background job that never exits. With the 3570s default from 2026-09-07 (code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent#7720) such a goal parked for an hour before it could notice. The owner decided that a full re-check turn every 4m30s is the right price for never stranding a goal on a source that will not deliver. The event-driven drain fire stays the normal path, and a wait you trust can opt back into the cheaper long backstop with `promptCache.goalBackstopMaxSeconds: 3570`.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The delay is chosen inside the built-in goal continuation coordinator, which owns the wake-source ledger, the single-flight timer, and the admission verdict. No extension hook can observe or replace that timer.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `GOAL_MONITOR_BACKSTOP_DEFAULT_DELAY_MS` constant and its doc comment in `cache-warm.ts`.
- LOW: the `resolveGoalMonitorContinuationDelayMs` docstring and the `#schedule` comment.

## 2026-09-07 - The monitor wait is a stall backstop, not a cache-warm cadence (code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent#7720)

### What changed

- `cache-warm.ts`: `resolveGoalMonitorContinuationDelayMs` takes only `goalBackstopMaxSeconds` and no longer reads the prompt-cache safe wait. It returns `goalBackstopMaxSeconds * 1000` (default `GOAL_MONITOR_BACKSTOP_DEFAULT_DELAY_MS`, 3_570_000, for a missing, non-finite, or non-positive setting) clamped into [1s, 1h]. `GOAL_MONITOR_CONTINUATION_FALLBACK_DELAY_MS` stays exported as the accounting fallback for a continuation whose scheduled delay is no longer known; it is never the armed delay.
- `monitor-continuation.ts`: `#schedule` passes only `getPromptCacheGoalBackstopMaxSeconds()`, so a live wake source arms the stall backstop instead of a ~270s cache-safe timer. The drain fire in `#setWakeSourceCount` (1s after the last wake source reaches zero) stays the single normal continuation path, and the backstop still admits one continuation if it fires while sources are live. `GOAL_MONITOR_BACKSTOP_DEFAULT_DELAY_MS` is re-exported here for callers and tests.
- `cache-warm-renderer.ts`: the scheduled notice says "Stall backstop ... - the goal resumes as soon as a wake source delivers" instead of claiming the timed wake keeps the prompt cache warm. Event names (`goal_continuation_scheduled`, `goal_continuation_resumed`, `goal_continuation_timer_state`) and the `goal-cache-warmup` entry type are unchanged, because omo-desktop-app consumes them.

### Why

- With the default 5m Anthropic TTL the backstop was a 270s timer, and every firing admitted a `monitorDelayed` continuation - a full main-model turn - even though wake sources were still live. The turn ended, `afterAgentEnd` re-armed the timer, and the session paid for the whole accumulated context every ~4m30s for as long as it waited, with no progress to show for it. The wait exists to let the wake sources deliver; a timer is only needed to break a stall.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The delay is chosen inside the built-in goal continuation coordinator, which owns the wake-source ledger, the single-flight timer, and the admission verdict. No extension hook can observe or replace that timer.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `resolveGoalMonitorContinuationDelayMs` signature and its single call site in `#schedule`.
- LOW: the scheduled-phase `whyLine` string in `cache-warm-renderer.ts`.

## 2026-09-07 - Block continuation after an unrecovered context overflow (#1422)

### What changed

- `continuation.ts`: `GoalContinuationInput.lastTurnStuckOnContextOverflow` and the `context-overflow` deny reason; `evaluateGoalContinuation` denies on every automatic path when the last turn was stuck on a context overflow, before eligibility.
- `continuation-recovery.ts`: `CONTEXT_OVERFLOW_BLOCKED_REASON` ("context overflow ended the turn (compaction did not recover)") joins the mechanical blocks, so accepted direct input resumes the goal.
- `lifecycle-helpers.ts` / `monitor-continuation.ts`: the verdict input derives the flag from the last assistant message through `core/compaction/stuck-overflow.ts` (agent-end paths and session-start).

### Why

- A provider overflow was treated like any terminal provider error: `providerRecovery` re-sent the identical context and the provider rejected it identically, three times in 30 s in the reported session. The context does not change between attempts, so re-prompting is deterministic failure.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the verdict input type, the deny-reason union, and `blockedReasonForContinuationGuard`.

## 2026-09-04 - update_goal points at the audits instead of restating them

### What changed

- `tool-registration.ts`: the `update_goal` description drops the blocked-audit prose (live-resumption-channel test, three-consecutive-turn recurrence, hard/slow/uncertain caveat) that `buildContinuationPrompt` already teaches on every goal turn. It now states what the tool itself enforces: the audits decide, `complete` is rejected while todo tasks are open, `blocked` needs a reason, resume restarts the blocked audit, pause/resume are not this tool, and the final usage report follows a successful `complete`.
- `prompt.ts`: the continuation prompt drops its own two repetitions - the trailing "do not call update_goal unless the audit is satisfied" line (already the first sentence of both audits) and the "repeating that the work is done" clause (already in the four-ways bullet).

### Why

- The same policy shipped twice per goal turn: 254 tokens in the tool schema and again inside the 819-token continuation prompt. Behavior is unchanged because the continuation prompt remains the single home of both audits and is present whenever a goal is active.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the description string literal and the two removed lines in the prompt array.

## 2026-08-28 - RPC session resume does not deadlock on stopped-goal prompts

### What changed

- `index.ts` leaves paused or blocked Goals stopped during RPC `switch_session` rebinding instead of awaiting the
  interactive restart prompt inside the in-flight RPC request. It emits an informational notification telling the
  user to resume explicitly after the session finishes loading.
- TUI resume behavior is unchanged: interactive sessions still offer `Resume goal` and `Leave stopped`.
- Coverage in `test/suite/goal-extension.test.ts` pins that RPC resume does not call `ctx.ui.select`, reactivate the
  Goal, or queue a continuation.

### Why

- The RPC client waits for the `switch_session` response before it can service the Goal extension's nested
  `ctx.ui.select` request. The host awaited that selection before returning the switch response, so both sides waited
  until the client timed out and exited without rendering the hidden error.

### Why an extension couldn't do it

- The stopped-goal restart prompt and its persisted status transition are private to the builtin Goal extension. An
  external extension cannot bypass or reorder that handler during RPC session rebinding.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW in `index.ts` around `maybePromptResumeStoppedGoal` and its mode-specific UI policy.

## 2026-08-27 - TUI widget rendering for goal tool results

### What changed

- `renderers.ts` (new): `renderGoalToolCall` / `renderGoalToolResult` render the goal tools as
  a widget instead of the raw `JSON.stringify({goal:...})` dump — status-colored header
  (glyph + status + compact tokens + elapsed), objective preview (collapsed: first two
  non-empty lines, 120-col shorten, `… +N more lines`) or the full objective plus
  `created/updated` ISO timestamps (expanded), a `⚠ <blockedReason>` line, and the
  objective-truncation notice. Falls back to parsing the legacy JSON text when `details`
  are absent (old sessions), and to the raw text when nothing parses.
- `format.ts`: adds `GoalToolRenderDetails` + `goalToolRenderDetails()` so tool results
  carry the snapshot in `details` for the renderer.
- `tool-registration.ts`: `create_goal` / `update_goal` / `get_goal` register
  `renderCall`/`renderResult` and attach the render details. The model-facing JSON text
  result is unchanged.
- Tests: `test/goal-renderers.test.ts`.

## 2026-08-27 - unattended continuation backstop (#1139)

### What changed

- `types.ts` adds the persisted `Goal.unattendedContinuations` counter;
  `persistence.ts` sanitizes it like the other continuation state.
- `store.ts` increments it on every counted `recordContinuationDelivered`
  (new `countUnattended` option, default on), zeroes it on any status
  transition alongside `consecutiveContinuations`, and
  `resetContinuationStreak(ref, { unattended: true })` clears it on accepted
  direct user input (`direct-input-lifecycle.ts`, both branches).
- `continuation.ts` adds `GOAL_UNATTENDED_CONTINUATION_LIMIT = 150` and a new
  `"unattended"` deny reason: any counted path
  (immediate/userGrace/sessionStart/systemRecovery/providerRecovery) is denied
  once the budget is exhausted; `monitorDelayed` is exempt because armed-wake
  waiting is by-design and rate-limited by the cache-aware timer.
- `continuation-recovery.ts` / `lifecycle-helpers.ts` map the deny to a new
  mechanical block reason `unattended continuation limit reached`, so the
  existing "Send any message to resume" recovery applies.
  `goal_continuation_guard_tripped` now also carries `unattendedContinuations`.

### Why

- #539/#567 progress semantics reset the persisted streak on any tool use or
  changed narration, so a stalled agent that varies its status text
  self-authorizes continuations forever (observed: 289 continuations without
  direct input, 122 consecutive zero-tool turns, 45.7M tokens). The limit sits
  above the #447 distinct-progress pin (50) and an 8-hour monitor-backstop
  cadence (~120 deliveries at 240s), below the observed incident run.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Delivery accounting, the persisted goal store, and continuation admission are
  private state inside the builtin Goal extension; no external hook can veto an
  admission or observe per-delivery accounting.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW in `continuation.ts` (constants + verdict union), `store.ts`
  (continuation mutators), and `lifecycle-helpers.ts` (guard mapping).

## 2026-08-26 - continuation timer survives a retired extension context

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/monitor-continuation.ts`
  routes every `hasUI` read through a new private `#ctxHasUI(ctx)` helper that
  treats the stale-ctx error (`stale-context.ts`) as "no UI" and rethrows
  anything else. The three affected reads are `#armTimer`'s pre-arm wait-ticker
  sync, the `setTimeout` callback's own `catch` handler, and the toolless stall
  notice in `#buildContinuationContent`. The timer callback additionally drops a
  rejection that is itself a stale-ctx error, since that is the expected outcome
  after a session replacement. Covered by
  `test/suite/goal-ticker-stale-context.test.ts`.

### Why

- `ctx.hasUI` is an `assertActive()`-guarded getter, so a context retired by
  session replacement or reload THROWS rather than returning false. The existing
  `this.#ctx?.hasUI` optional chaining only guarded the `undefined` that
  `dispose()` leaves behind, not the stale object left when a session is replaced
  without disposing this monitor. Because the read happened inside a bare
  `setTimeout` callback, the throw escaped as an uncaughtException and killed the
  session (reported in the wild from `runner.js` `assertActive` via `hasUI`).

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The armed continuation timer, the retained `#ctx`, and the continuation
  admission path are all private state inside the builtin Goal extension; no
  external hook observes or wraps that callback.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW in `monitor-continuation.ts` around `#armTimer` and
  `#buildContinuationContent` where the `hasUI` reads are now helper calls.

## 2026-08-24 - provider retry exhaustion uses guarded recovery

### What changed

- `index.ts`, `agent-end-continuation.ts`, `monitor-continuation.ts`, and `continuation.ts` keep active Goals active after terminal provider/watchdog failures and queue one guarded `providerRecovery` continuation after `agent_settled`. Explicit user aborts remain blocked; system aborts retain `systemRecovery`; the legacy provider-error blocked reason remains resumable.

### Why

- Provider retry exhaustion is infrastructure failure, not a user decision. The previous block stranded active Goals.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Goal state transitions, settlement latches, and continuation admission are private to the builtin Goal extension.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: Goal agent-end routing and monitor continuation admission.

## Wait countdown hides while a turn runs (2026-08-24)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/wait-ticker.ts`
  `GoalWaitTicker.tick` now renders `undefined` (clearing the `goal-wait`
  footer segment) whenever `ctx.isIdle()` is false, and re-renders the
  countdown on the next idle tick. The armed continuation timer, its
  cache-TTL deadline, and the cache-warm iteration accounting are untouched;
  only the render follows session idleness.

### Why

- A turn started by a channel the goal continuation did not deliver (a
  monitor event, a task completion notification, a scheduled wakeup) left the
  parked wait countdown rendering over the Working indicator for the whole
  turn — observed live: `▰▰▰▱… goal continues in 2m 55s · 1 bash on duty`
  beside `Working (1m 10s)`. The label was doubly false: the goal was being
  pursued, not waited on, and the timer would no-op on `!ctx.isIdle()` when
  it fired.
- Cancelling the timer on foreign turn starts was rejected: the monitor wait
  schedule is cache-TTL-driven, so re-arming at the next agent_end resets
  the wake clock and corrupts cache-warm iteration accounting (proven by
  `goal-cache-warmup.test.ts`).

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The ticker and its render seam live inside the builtin goal extension
  itself; the idleness contract of its footer segment is the extension's own
  display logic, not a capability another extension can provide.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- None upstream: `wait-ticker.ts` is a fork-only file with no pi-mono
  counterpart.

## Cache-warm ready time renders in the local timezone (2026-08-22)

### What changed

- `cache-warm.ts` gains `formatWakeTimestamp(dueAtMs)`: it formats the expected
  wake time in the user's local system timezone via `Intl.DateTimeFormat`
  (`en-CA`, `hourCycle: "h23"`, short `timeZoneName`), producing
  `2026-08-22 16:51 GMT+9`-style stamps, and falls back to the legacy
  `<iso> UTC` shape when local formatting throws or returns incomplete parts.
- `cache-warm-renderer.ts` `formatExpectedWake` now delegates to
  `formatWakeTimestamp` instead of pinning `toISOString()` UTC output.

### Why

- The cache-warm notice showed `ready 2026-08-22 07:51 UTC (4m 30s)` regardless
  of the user's timezone, forcing mental conversion on every wait. Users read
  the line to know when the goal resumes; local time with a zone label answers
  directly, and UTC remains the fallback for platforms without ICU timezone
  data.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The renderer and its formatting helpers live inside the builtin goal
  extension itself; the change is the extension's own display logic, not a new
  capability another extension could provide.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- None upstream: `cache-warm.ts` and `cache-warm-renderer.ts` are fork-only
  files with no pi-mono counterpart.

## Reload re-engages active goals instead of parking them (2026-08-18, fixes #934)

### What changed

- `session_start` with reason `"reload"` now routes through
  `reload-reengagement.ts` (`reengageGoalAfterReload`) instead of skipping every
  goal. A non-active goal (paused/blocked/complete) is still skipped, so a
  reload never auto-starts an agent the user stopped. An active goal with live
  wake sources re-arms the monitor-delayed backstop via the new
  `MonitorAwareGoalContinuation.rearmMonitorBackstop`; an active goal without
  wake sources queues a continuation through the existing sessionStart
  admission, trailing-flood suppression included.
- `MonitorAwareGoalContinuation` gains `hasActiveWakeSources()` and
  `rearmMonitorBackstop(goal)`. The terminal builtin's reload `session_start`
  replays its monitor snapshots before Goal's handler runs (builtin order is
  load-bearing), so live-channel counts are already restored when the
  re-engagement decision reads them.

### Why

- A config reload retires the extension generation: `session_shutdown` disposes
  the continuation monitor, cancelling every armed timer (user grace, monitor
  backstop) with it. The 2026-07-27 guard then skipped re-engagement for ANY
  goal on reload, so an active goal mid-wait parked until the next user
  message; wake-source drain could not self-heal because drain-fire requires a
  scheduled monitor-kind continuation that never existed post-reload.
- The guard's protective case is already covered by status: every user stop
  marks the goal blocked via `session_abort` / `agent_end` abortSource "user",
  and the continuation evaluator denies non-active goals. Skipping active goals
  as well was over-broad and produced the reported stall.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The continuation timers, wake-source counts, and the reload admission
  decision are private to this builtin's monitor and `session_start` handler;
  an external extension cannot re-arm a disposed timer or observe the reload
  reason with the goal's continuation state.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW in `index.ts` around the `session_start` reload branch; LOW in
  `monitor-continuation.ts` around the new public accessors; LOW in the new
  `reload-reengagement.ts`.

## External continuation holds pause Goal monitor recovery until release (2026-08-18)

### What changed

- Goal now subscribes to the shared `continuation_hold_state` event through a
  focused channel-subscription module. An active source maps to the existing
  `holdDirectInput("external:<source>")` mechanism; release maps to
  `resolveDirectInput(..., false)`.
- Existing terminal-monitor and `wake_source_state` subscriptions moved into
  the same helper without changing their count or timer semantics.

### Why

- A wake source deliberately schedules periodic Goal continuation while work is
  live. Loop-guard's post-recovery hard stop needs the opposite contract:
  preserve the active Goal but prevent every automatic continuation until real
  input releases ownership.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The continuation timer and direct-input hold set are private to Goal. A
  generic event is the narrow boundary that lets another builtin claim and
  release terminal ownership without importing Goal internals or changing Goal
  status.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW in `monitor-continuation.ts` channel subscription wiring; LOW in the new
  `channel-state-subscriptions.ts`; LOW in wake-source tests.

## Claude SDK OAuth account exhaustion blocks the goal (2026-08-14)

### What changed

- `didTerminalProviderErrorEndTurn` now also classifies the claude-sdk-oauth account-rotating proxy's total-exhaustion response as a terminal provider error. The proxy returns it as an assistant message with `stopReason: "stop"` and zero usage, so it previously slipped past the stopReason checks and the goal kept auto-continuing.
- The match requires `api: "claude-sdk-oauth"`, `stopReason: "stop"`, and both stable phrases (`API Error: Server is temporarily limiting requests` and `accounts exhausted`); the account count and the `Retry in NNNs` suffix vary and are not matched.

### Why

- An active goal treated the exhaustion response as a clean turn end and queued another hidden continuation, looping failed zero-token requests until the continuation cap fired. The goal now blocks mechanically and resumes on the next accepted user message.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Terminal provider-error classification lives in this builtin's `terminal-provider-error.ts`; an external extension cannot intercept the goal's block decision.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `terminal-provider-error.ts` classification; LOW in `goal-extension.test.ts`.

## Explicit resume revives completed goals (2026-08-11)

### What changed

- User-originated status mutations may transition a completed goal back to `active`, so `/goal resume` and app-server `thread/goal/set {status:"active"}` revive the existing goal and queue the normal continuation path.
- Resuming clears `completedAt`, stamps `lastStartedAt`, and resets persisted continuation streak state through the existing status-transition behavior.
- Model-originated transitions remain unchanged, `complete -> paused` remains illegal, and restart-resume prompting still excludes completed goals.

### Why

Codex permits an explicit user action to reactivate a completed thread goal. Senpi parsed `/goal resume` and wired continuation delivery correctly, but its user transition guard rejected `complete -> active` before that path could run.

### Why this is not extension-only

The transition guard is private to the builtin goal store and controls both the command and app-server wire paths. An external extension cannot authorize a new persisted status edge.

### Merge-conflict zones

- LOW in `transitions.ts` around the user transition set.
- LOW in goal store and command-path tests covering completed-goal resume.

## Serialized goal mutations and stale-continuation cancellation (2026-08-10)

### What changed

- Goal read/modify/write operations now serialize per persisted goal file while unrelated threads remain parallel.
- Continuation delivery records only when the admitted goal id is still current; a clear or replacement cancels stale delivery before any hidden prompt is queued.
- App-server clear no longer races asynchronous `goal_store_changed` continuation accounting and cannot resurrect a cleared goal.

### Why

`goal_store_changed` listeners are asynchronous and fire outside the app-server thread task queue. A continuation could read an active goal, then overwrite a later clear with its stale snapshot. Store-level serialization is required because commands, tools, lifecycle callbacks, monitors, and RPC handlers all mutate the same persisted goal outside one shared handler queue.

### Why this is not extension-only

The race is inside the builtin goal persistence contract and app-server event path. An external extension cannot make core store mutations linearizable or prevent the builtin continuation listener from committing a stale read.

### Merge-conflict zones

- `store.ts`: per-goal mutation queue and serialized mutation functions.
- `lifecycle-helpers.ts`: expected goal-id fence and stale cancellation.
- `index.ts`, `monitor-continuation.ts`: nullable stale-admission handling.

## Unified wake-source continuation gating (2026-08-09)

### What changed

- Goal dual-subscribes to `wake_source_state` and the permanent `terminal_monitor_state` alias, storing last-write-wins counts by source and gating on their sum.
- Scheduled/resumed events and cache-warm entries retain `activeMonitorCount` as the aggregate compatibility field and add the complete `wakeSources` snapshot.
- Draining the aggregate count to zero while a monitor wait is armed replaces the long backstop with a one-second drain fire that bypasses the zero-count guard; its resumed record keeps the pre-reset warm iteration.
- App-server `thread/goal/set` publishes `goal_store_changed`, allowing the builtin to queue an active goal on an idle session.

### Why

Background work could remain live outside terminal monitors, and a final source drain previously cancelled the only continuation timer without delivering work. RPC-created goals also had no lifecycle edge to wake an idle agent.

### Why an extension couldn't do it

The continuation gate, iteration reset order, goal store, and app-server session event bus are fork-owned builtin/core surfaces.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- HIGH in `monitor-continuation.ts` around source snapshots, timer firing, and iteration reset order.
- MEDIUM in `index.ts` and app-server goal handlers around the internal store-change event.

## Cache-safe backstops and warm-iteration ordinals (2026-08-09)

### What changed

- Monitor continuation delays snapshot the active extension context's prompt-cache safe-wait budget and apply the configured `promptCache.goalBackstopMaxSeconds` ceiling, with the former four-minute value retained only as the unknown-budget fallback.
- Direct-input holds now consume elapsed wall-clock time instead of restarting the held remainder, and wait progress keeps the originally scheduled total.
- Cache-warm rendering stops claiming that tokens remained warm or produced savings when the planned or actual wait reaches the displayed cache TTL.
- Cache-warm scheduled/resumed events and durable entries carry an optional per-epoch iteration ordinal; legacy entries omit the iteration wording.

### Why

- Provider lanes expose materially different cache-safe budgets. A fixed four-minute backstop wakes long-TTL lanes too often and ignores the existing provider-aware budget resolver.
- Input admission time is still real cache age, so pausing the timer during admission could overrun the captured budget.
- Iteration ordinals make repeated warm cycles understandable without persisting session-global state or mislabeling old entries.

### Why an extension couldn't do it

- The resolved prompt-cache budget and merged settings are owned by the session core and must cross the typed extension-context boundary.
- Goal's monitor timer, durable entry payload, and renderer are private builtin implementation surfaces.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM in `monitor-continuation.ts`, `cache-warm.ts`, and `cache-warm-renderer.ts` around scheduling and entry payloads.
- LOW in `settings-manager.ts`, extension context plumbing, and goal-monitor test harnesses.

## Reload snapshots survive first session start (2026-08-09)

### What changed

- `MonitorAwareGoalContinuation` preserves source-keyed channel snapshots received
  before its first `start()`, while a subsequent `start()` on the same instance
  still clears counts from the replaced session.
- Integration coverage runs Terminal before Goal on one event bus, parks live
  monitor and background-bash state across a real reload lifecycle, and verifies
  both replayed snapshots delay Goal continuation after the new runner starts.

### Why

- Builtin order is load-bearing: Terminal's reload `session_start` claims and binds
  its parked bundle before Goal's handler runs. `bind()` immediately replays both
  terminal snapshots to the newly constructed Goal instance, so clearing counts on
  that instance's first `start()` discarded current-session liveness with no later
  transition available to restore it.
- Pre-first-start snapshots belong to the fresh runner generation. Only a later
  same-instance `start()` represents a genuine session replacement whose old
  snapshots must be discarded.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW in `monitor-continuation.ts` around `start()` lifecycle reset behavior.

## System-owned aborts stay active through Goal recovery (2026-08-05)

### What changed

- Explicit `abortSource: "system"` terminal abort events no longer enter Goal's
  retries-exhausted provider-error blocking branch, including TTSR's
  provider-error shell with `stopReason: "error"`.
- A system-owned aborted `agent_end` is treated as the start of extension-owned
  recovery rather than as a clean user turn: it preserves any existing timer,
  avoids arming user grace, and lets the recovery end arm the live monitor wait.
  If no automatic retry remains, an active monitor wait is armed immediately so
  the Goal still has a live resumption channel.
- If a system-owned provider error has neither an automatic retry nor an active
  monitor, Goal stages its hidden `systemRecovery` continuation until
  `agent_settled`. This launches recovery from the idle-compatible path instead
  of leaving a native follow-up stranded behind the error stop, while a user
  abort during `agent_end` or settlement cancels the staged delivery and clears
  its single-flight latch, so an explicit `/goal resume` can admit a fresh
  continuation. The path bypasses only idle/terminal-stop eligibility and
  retains the persisted cap, repetition, pending-message, and single-flight
  guards.
- If one of those guards blocks recovery during `agent_settled`, the returned
  Goal status now flows through the same accounting and TUI refresh path as an
  `agent_end` continuation decision; the footer no longer remains
  `Pursuing goal` after persistence has changed the Goal to blocked.
- Provenance-free terminal aborted responses still block as provider failures,
  while explicit user aborts retain the dedicated `user interrupted the turn`
  block.
- Production-shaped coverage includes `willRetry: false`, an aborted assistant
  message, active monitor state, and the combined TTSR recovery continuation.

### Why

- TTSR owns a corrective recovery turn after its system abort. Treating that
  abort as a provider failure transiently blocked the Goal, disarmed monitor
  continuation ownership, and contradicted the internal-interruption contract.
- Restricting the exemption to explicit system provenance preserves existing
  protection for provider-originated terminal aborts with no source.

### Why an extension couldn't do it

- The classification and resulting Goal status transition are private to this
  builtin's `agent_end` handler.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `agent-end-continuation.ts`, `continuation.ts`, and
  `monitor-continuation.ts` around system-abort staging and settlement routing.

## Cache-warm waits are widget-owned (2026-08-05)

### What changed

- Monitor-delayed Goal continuations no longer emit transient scheduled/resumed
  `ctx.ui.notify` messages.
- The now-dead notice builders and their prose-only tests were removed.
- The durable `goal-cache-warmup` entry remains the single notice box for the
  cache-warm story, while the `goal-wait` status ticker remains the live
  countdown surface.

### Why

- The transient notifications repeated the same scheduled/resumed event already
  rendered by the durable entry. One event now has one display owner without
  changing the continuation timer, prompt-cache metrics, wake event, or hidden
  Goal continuation message.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW in `monitor-continuation.ts` around monitor schedule and resume reporting.

## Cache-warm entry renderer delegates to the shared notice kit (2026-08-04)

### What changed

- `cache-warm-renderer.ts` now renders through `noticeEntryRenderer` from `src/core/extensions/notice/`. The exported `renderGoalCacheWarmupEntry` symbol, registration, title/why/warm/expanded text, accent and success tones, and expand behavior are unchanged; `goal-cache-warm-renderer.test.ts` passes unmodified.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW in `cache-warm-renderer.ts`; NONE in cache-warm metrics, continuation, or persistence.

## A terminal provider error is a prompt-recoverable block (2026-08-04)

### What changed

- `continuation-recovery.ts` exports `PROVIDER_ERROR_BLOCKED_REASON` and adds it to
  `MECHANICAL_CONTINUATION_BLOCKS`, so `isMechanicalContinuationBlock` classifies a
  retries-exhausted provider error alongside the cap, repetition, and length guards.
- `index.ts` writes that shared constant instead of repeating the literal reason and
  appends `continuationCapRecoveryHint(...)` to the blocked notice, so the TUI warning
  now ends with `Send any message to resume.` instead of only naming the failure.
- `GoalDirectInputLifecycle.onDisposition` needed no change: reactivating a mechanically
  blocked goal on accepted direct input already existed, and the provider-error reason
  now flows through it.

### Why

- A terminal provider error is infrastructure, not a decision. The user's next message is
  exactly the retry signal, so leaving the goal blocked stranded a live run behind a state
  only `/goal resume` could clear, while the notice never said so.
- Intentional blocks stay non-recoverable: `user interrupted the turn` and model-declared
  `update_goal` blocks are still excluded, because those encode a decision to stop.
- This is the in-session counterpart to the restart resume prompt below: that entry recovers
  a stopped goal when a new session loads it, this one recovers it mid-session without a
  restart or a prompt.

### Why an extension couldn't do it

- Both the block-reason writer and the mechanical-block classifier live inside this builtin;
  the policy has no public extension hook.

### Expected merge-conflict zones

- `continuation-recovery.ts` `MECHANICAL_CONTINUATION_BLOCKS` and its exported reason constants.
- `index.ts` `agent_end` terminal-provider-error branch and its import block.

## Restart resume prompt covers every stopped-but-unfinished goal (2026-08-04)

### What changed

- `lifecycle-helpers.ts` renames `isResumeOfPausedGoal` to `isResumeOfStoppedGoal`
  and admits the whole stopped-but-unfinished set (`paused` and `blocked`) instead
  of `paused` alone. The idle / has-UI / no-pending-messages guards and the
  `"resume"` session-start reason are unchanged.
- `index.ts` renames `maybePromptResumePausedGoal` to
  `maybePromptResumeStoppedGoal`, renames the `LEAVE_GOAL_PAUSED_CHOICE` constant
  to `LEAVE_GOAL_STOPPED_CHOICE` (`"Leave stopped"`), and interpolates the goal's
  real status into the prompt title (`Resume blocked goal?` / `Resume paused
  goal?`) so the dialog names the state the user is actually resuming from.
- Accepting the prompt is unchanged: the goal flips to `active` via a `"user"`
  mutation, accounting restarts, the footer refreshes, and a continuation is
  queued through the same admission path.

### Why

- Ports the upstream codex rule in
  `codex-rs/tui/src/app/thread_goal_actions.rs`
  (`maybe_prompt_resume_paused_goal_after_resume`), which prompts on resume for
  `Paused | Blocked | UsageLimited` — every status that stopped the goal without
  finishing it. senpi previously ported only the `paused` arm.
- A `blocked` goal was unrecoverable on restart: no prompt fired, and the
  session-start auto-continuation denied it with `not-eligible` because the
  status is not `active`. The goal stayed blocked with no user-visible
  affordance, even though `blocked` is reached by ordinary events — a user
  interrupt, a terminal provider error, or a tripped continuation guard.
- senpi stays budget-free, so codex's `UsageLimited` arm has no counterpart and
  no budget status is introduced. The senpi stopped set is exactly
  `paused | blocked`; `complete` and `active` are untouched.

### Expected merge conflict zones on the next sync

- LOW in `lifecycle-helpers.ts` around the renamed predicate and its status set;
  standalone `pi-goal` has no restart resume prompt.
- LOW in `index.ts` around the `session_start` handler's resume-prompt call and
  the choice constants.

## Legacy `pi-goal` state is imported once at session start (2026-07-31)

### What changed

- `persistence.ts` exports `migrateLegacyGoalFile(ref)`, and `index.ts` awaits it
  before the session's first `readGoal`, so imported state participates
  immediately.
- Legacy-only parsing deletes the old `tokenBudget` enforcement input and maps
  `budgetLimited` / `budget_limited` to `active`. Current-store reads do not run
  that normalization, so inert wire metadata and existing typed validation errors
  are preserved.
- Migration publication now uses `writeFile` with `flag: "wx"` and mode `0600`.
  This keeps atomic exclusive-create precedence without hard-link support, temp
  cleanup machinery, or a temp sibling that can be orphaned by `SIGKILL`.
- Invalid, unsupported-version, and malformed legacy files are best-effort dead
  data: they remain on disk, return no import, and do not brick the live current
  store. Unexpected filesystem errors still propagate.
- Successfully imported files, explicit-null files, and files that lose the
  exclusive-create race are renamed to a sibling `.migrated` archive on a
  best-effort basis, so completed migration is not retried on every startup.
- Segment-aware `goal` -> `pi-goal` mapping accepts both `/` and `\\` separators
  while retaining exact path-segment matching; names such as `my-goal` are never
  rewritten.
- Session-backed migration keeps its stable thread-id lookup. No-session migration
  instead enumerates the cwd-keyed `*.json` bucket because ephemeral sessions get
  a new id on every run. It searches both the legacy bucket beside the redirected
  Senpi root and `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` (default `~/.pi/agent`), and reports an
  explicit conflict when multiple valid live goals exist rather than guessing.

### Why

- Standalone `pi-goal` and the builtin can use different agent roots, and
  no-session filenames contain an old ephemeral session id. Rewriting only the
  current Senpi path and looking up the new id silently missed the headline
  print/in-memory upgrade path.
- Hard links fail on common non-POSIX and network filesystems. Exclusive `wx`
  creation provides the same no-clobber result portably and removes the crash-time
  orphan-temp-file durability wart.
- A stale corrupt migration source is not authoritative live state. Ignoring its
  expected parse/schema failures keeps goal creation usable while preserving the
  source for manual recovery.
- Retiring a consumed source makes migration genuinely one-shot without deleting
  the user's old data.

### Expected merge conflict zones on the next sync

- LOW in `persistence.ts` around legacy candidate discovery and `parseGoalFile`'s
  `legacy` option; standalone `pi-goal` has no migration path.
- LOW in `index.ts` at the `session_start` migration call.
- NONE in the store schema, tool schemas, status transitions, or public API.

## Mechanical continuation blocks tell the user how to resume (2026-07-31)

### What changed

- New `continuation-recovery.ts` owns the three mechanical continuation-guard
  reasons (`continuation cap reached`, `repeated assistant output`,
  `output truncation repeated`) as exported constants, classifies them with
  `isMechanicalContinuationBlock`, and builds the user notice with
  `continuationCapRecoveryHint`.
- `lifecycle-helpers.ts` consumes both: `blockedReasonForContinuationGuard`
  returns the named constants, and the blocked notify now renders
  `Goal continuation blocked: <reason>. Send any message to resume.` for
  mechanical guards only.
- Intentional blocks (`user interrupted the turn`, provider-error exhaustion,
  model-authored blocks) keep the bare notice; no resume guidance is implied
  where a message does not clear the block.

### Why

- A user reported that `continuation cap reached` "stops the session so much"
  and "is not an easy guardrail to pass". The cap is a deliberate runaway
  backstop and already resets on tool use or observable progress, and
  `before_agent_start` already reactivates a cap-blocked goal on any real user
  prompt. The gap was purely informational: the warning named the guard without
  saying that one ordinary message clears it, so the state read as terminal.
- Behavior of the guard itself is unchanged: `GOAL_CONTINUATION_CAP` stays 8,
  admission logic is untouched, and the existing prompt-based recovery path is
  preserved rather than replaced.

### Expected merge conflict zones on the next sync

- LOW in `lifecycle-helpers.ts` around the guard-reason switch and the notify call.
- NONE in the verdict engine, goal store schema, persistence, or public extension API.
## Monitor-delayed continuations consume the persisted cap (2026-07-31)

### What changed

- `continuation.ts` applies the inclusive eight-delivery cap to every automatic
  continuation path, including `monitorDelayed`.
- `lifecycle-helpers.ts` now requires a continuation signature and persists the
  delivery before queueing its hidden prompt. Missing or failed persistence
  therefore fails closed instead of delivering an unaccounted continuation.
- Coverage adds the issue #506 monitor-delay regression, proves the eighth
  delayed delivery is persisted and the next is blocked, and keeps delayed test
  synchronization tied to exact persistence writes rather than timer luck.

### Why

- Monitor-delayed delivery was exempt from both cap admission and persistence
  accounting. Repeated monitor wakeups could therefore queue hidden Goal turns
  without consuming the restart-safe delivery budget introduced for #447.

### Expected merge conflict zones on the next sync

- LOW in `continuation.ts` around the cap verdict and in
  `lifecycle-helpers.ts` around continuation delivery ordering.
- LOW in monitor continuation tests that observe delayed persistence.
- NONE in the goal store schema, public extension API, or status transitions.

## Visible continuation-wait countdown (2026-08-03)

### What changed

- `wait-progress.ts` exports the clamped 12-cell progress bar and the user-grace / monitor
  wait-label formatter, reusing `formatWakeDuration` so countdowns match existing cache-warm
  notices.
- New `wait-ticker.ts` follows the existing `GoalElapsedTicker` / `MonitorStatusTicker` pattern:
  it renders a dedicated `goal-wait` footer status immediately, refreshes once per second on an
  unref'd interval, skips unchanged labels, and clears the status when its timer ends or is
  cancelled.
- `monitor-continuation.ts` now drives that ticker from the real delayed-continuation lifecycle.
  It restores the 60-second `userGrace` continuation after a clean accepted user turn, keeps the
  existing four-minute monitor delay, freezes both timers while direct-input admission is
  unresolved, resumes rejected/handled holds with their remaining time, and clears the footer on
  delivery, accepted replacement input, goal state changes, monitor settlement, reload, and
  shutdown.
- The countdown is footer-only and transient. It does not append a durable entry: a transcript
  line per user-grace window would be permanent noise for a state whose value changes every
  second. The existing durable `goal-cache-warmup` story remains unchanged for monitor waits.
- Coverage keeps the nine pure rendering tests and adds lifecycle wiring assertions that observe
  the real user-grace status before triggering the turn, advance it with fake time, then await
  exact delivery/clear signals; cancellation is likewise observed before accepted input and
  proves no later delivery or status tick leaks.

### Why

The original 60-second grace path left an active Goal silent and visually indistinguishable from
an idle or hung session. PR #553 later removed that timer while improving correlated direct-input
admission. This change intentionally restores the grace continuation requested here without
removing those safeguards: accepted input still cancels an already-armed wait synchronously, and
only the clean end of that accepted user turn starts a fresh visible grace window.

A dedicated footer ticker matches the TUI's established live-status mechanism and keeps the
countdown independent from cumulative `Pursuing goal (…)` elapsed time. Durable timeline entries
cannot represent per-second state without transcript spam, so they are the wrong rendering
surface for this wait.

### Why the extension system could not handle this differently

The scheduler and footer status are already private implementation details of the builtin Goal
extension. The wiring stays entirely inside that builtin and uses the public `ctx.ui.setStatus`
surface; no core extension API change is required.

### Expected merge conflict zones on the next sync

- MEDIUM in `monitor-continuation.ts` around delayed timer ownership and direct-input holds.
- LOW in `continuation.ts` for the restored `userGrace` path and in `index.ts` for ticker wiring.
- LOW in the focused Goal monitor lifecycle tests and harness status signal.
- NONE in the Goal store schema, public extension API, or durable cache-warm entry contract.

## Observable progress resets the persisted continuation cap streak (2026-07-30)

### What changed

- `continuation.ts` now exposes `hasGoalContinuationProgress`, which treats a
  changed persisted continuation signature as observable goal progress.
- `monitor-continuation.ts` resets `consecutiveContinuations` before the next
  admission when a non-user continuation turn either used tools or changed that
  signature. The verdict is rebuilt from the reset goal so the cap remains a
  backstop for uninterrupted non-progress rather than a raw turn counter.
- The cap stays at 8, remains inclusive at the boundary, and still applies to
  immediate, user-grace, and session-start paths. User-prompt resets,
  single-flight delivery, stale/repetition/length guards, monitor scheduling,
  and blocked-state deduplication are unchanged.
- Coverage rewrites the former distinct-text cap pins in
  `goal-monitor-continuation.test.ts` and
  `regressions/issue-447-goal-continuation.test.ts`, and adds an explicit
  below-cap/at-cap verdict boundary assertion.

### Why

- Codex has no deterministic continuation counter; its blocked audit restarts
  whenever the goal makes meaningful progress. Senpi intentionally retains an
  eight-turn safety cap, but previously reset it only for tool use. A goal that
  made distinct toolless progress therefore blocked on the ninth continuation,
  resumed on user input, then repeated the same false block cycle.

### Expected merge conflict zones on the next sync

- LOW in `continuation.ts` around signature helpers and in
  `monitor-continuation.ts` around `afterAgentEnd`.
- LOW in the two cap regression tests whose old expectations encoded raw turn
  counting rather than progress-aware streak accounting.
- NONE in persistence schema, public extension API, or goal status transitions.

## Tool-using continuations reset the persisted cap streak (2026-07-30)

### What changed

- `monitor-continuation.ts` now classifies tool use once from the completed
  continuation turn and resets the persisted `consecutiveContinuations` streak
  before admitting the next immediate or user-grace continuation.
- The existing cap remains 8 consecutive tool-less automatic continuations.
  Monitor-delayed accounting, stale/repetition guards, single-flight delivery,
  user-prompt resets, and session-start persistence are unchanged.
- Coverage: `test/suite/goal-monitor-continuation.test.ts` runs nine consecutive
  tool-using turns and proves they remain active while the existing tool-less
  boundary test still blocks the ninth continuation.

### Why

- Tool calls are observable progress, but the persisted cap previously counted
  every automatic continuation delivery. A long-running goal that kept using
  tools therefore blocked itself after eight turns with `continuation cap
  reached`, even though the separate stall detector already recognized those
  turns as non-stalled.

### Expected merge conflict zones on the next sync

- LOW in `monitor-continuation.ts` around `afterAgentEnd` and the tool-less
  streak helper.
- NONE in the verdict engine, goal store schema, persistence, or public
  extension API.

## A newly created goal starts immediately instead of waiting for user grace (2026-07-30)

### What changed

- The `create_goal` tool registration now marks the current turn goal-driven before opening
  the new goal accounting window. The clean `agent_end` therefore queues the first hidden
  continuation immediately instead of treating the explicit goal-creation request like a
  side question on an already-active goal and waiting for the 60-second grace timer.
- The existing grace policy is unchanged for real user turns that begin with a pre-existing
  active goal. Monitor delays, continuation caps, repetition/stale guards, and single-flight
  delivery are also unchanged.
- Coverage: `test/suite/regressions/goal-created-turn-continuation.test.ts` reproduces the
  exact lifecycle (`before_agent_start` -> `agent_start` -> `create_goal` -> clean
  `agent_end`) and asserts one immediate `goal-continuation` message.

### Why

- The observed release-goal session created the goal, stopped normally, and then remained
  idle for the full user-grace window. The user sent the next instruction at 59 seconds,
  just before the scheduled continuation, so the goal appeared abandoned even though the
  footer still showed it as active.

### Expected merge conflict zones on the next sync

- LOW in `index.ts` at the dependency passed to `registerGoalTools`.
- NONE in the continuation verdict, persistence, prompt, or public extension API.

## Waiting on a live resumption channel is never a blocked goal (2026-07-30)

### What changed

- `prompt.ts` `buildContinuationPrompt`: the turn-ending rule now names four legal endings
  instead of three - action, `update_goal` complete, `update_goal` blocked, or ending the
  turn while a live resumption channel (active monitor, scheduled continuation, or
  background child whose completion wakes the session) is on duty. The blocked audit gains
  a first gate: confirm no such channel can still deliver the awaited change, because a
  pending delivery is a wait, not an impasse. Fixes the observed failure where a session
  armed with a CI completion monitor called `update_goal` blocked on the same turn the
  monitor was registered.
- `tool-registration.ts`: the `update_goal` description now requires confirming no live
  resumption channel exists before blocking and routes monitored waits to ending the turn.
- Coverage: `test/suite/goal-modules.test.ts` (two new continuation-prompt pins) and
  `test/suite/goal-extension.test.ts` (two new `update_goal` description pins).

### Expected merge conflict zones on the next sync

- LOW in `prompt.ts` (fork-owned file) and `tool-registration.ts` (fork-owned); upstream
  owns neither.

## Stale-goal system reminder on todo add operations (2026-07-29)

### What changed

- `todo-gate.ts` gained the reverse-direction bridge: `todoResultAddsOpenTasks(details)`
  (structural guard: a todo result whose op is `init`/`append` and whose resulting phases
  still hold at least one open task) and `staleGoalTodoReminder(goal)` (a
  `<system-reminder>` block naming `create_goal` when the thread has no goal or only a
  stale, already-`complete` one; silent for active/paused/blocked goals).
- `index.ts` registers a `tool_result` handler on the builtin `todo` tool that appends the
  reminder to the tool-result content, plus a `turn_start` reset so at most one reminder
  is injected per assistant turn (init + append in the same turn nudges once). Mirrors the
  nested-agents-md `tool_result` injection pattern.
- Coverage: `test/suite/goal-todo-stale-reminder.test.ts` - unit pins for both helpers and
  four real-AgentSession e2e scenarios (no goal, stale complete goal, active goal +
  non-add ops stay silent, per-turn dedupe).

### Expected merge conflict zones on the next sync

- LOW in `index.ts` around the event-handler block and in `todo-gate.ts`; both are
  fork-owned surfaces.
- NONE in todotools: the feature reads `TodoToolDetails` structurally without touching the
  todo tool itself.

## Cache-warm continuation story: enriched events + durable entry + TUI renderer (2026-07-29)

### Follow-up: expected-ready timestamps in cache-warm status (2026-08-13)

- Scheduled cache-warm pi-events and durable `goal-cache-warmup` entries now carry an optional
  additive `dueAtMs` epoch timestamp derived from the producer's scheduling clock and `delayMs`.
  RPC consumers no longer need to approximate the completion point from receipt time.
- The TUI renderer names that expected UTC completion point and keeps the planned or actual
  elapsed duration in parentheses. Legacy entries and invalid timestamps retain the existing
  elapsed-only `waited ...` wording.
- The schedule payload builder lives in `cache-warm.ts` so the already oversized monitor
  orchestrator does not absorb another formatting/contract responsibility.
- Coverage: `goal-cache-warmup.test.ts`, `goal-monitor-rpc-notice.test.ts`, and
  `goal-cache-warm-renderer.test.ts`.

#### Why this lives in the fork

- Cache-warm continuation entries, monitor-aware scheduling, and their TUI renderer are
  fork-owned builtin Goal behavior. A consumer extension cannot amend an already-emitted
  durable entry with the producer's authoritative due timestamp.

#### Expected merge conflict zones on the next sync

- LOW in `cache-warm.ts` and `cache-warm-renderer.ts`, both fork-owned cache-warm surfaces.
- LOW in `monitor-continuation.ts` around the scheduled payload construction.

### What changed

- New `cache-warm.ts`: `estimateCacheWarmMetrics(model, env, lastTurnUsage)` derives
  `GoalCacheWarmMetrics {ttlSeconds?, cachedTokens, estimatedSavedUsd?}` - prompt-cache TTL via
  pi-ai `resolvePromptCacheTtlSeconds`, warm tokens = the last turn's cacheRead+cacheWrite, and
  savings = cachedTokens x (input - cacheRead) $/Mtok clamped >= 0 - plus the scheduled/resumed
  notice builders and shared token/duration/TTL/USD formatters.
- `monitor-continuation.ts`: the monitor-wait schedule notice now explains the cache-warm
  rationale (monitors on duty, timed wake inside the prompt-cache TTL, ~tokens kept warm) while
  preserving the "4 minutes" wording RPC clients match. `goal_continuation_scheduled` gains a
  `cache` payload member; a new `goal_continuation_resumed` pi-event fires when the deferred
  continuation is queued. Both moments append a durable `goal-cache-warmup` custom entry and the
  resumed side also notifies with waited time + estimated savings.
- New `cache-warm-renderer.ts`, registered in `index.ts` via
  `pi.registerEntryRenderer("goal-cache-warmup", ...)`: themed transcript block (bold accent
  title, dim why-line, success-colored warm/savings line; expanded adds goalId + planned delay).
- Coverage: `goal-cache-warm-metrics.test.ts`, `goal-cache-warmup.test.ts`,
  `goal-cache-warm-renderer.test.ts`; the goal monitor harness gained
  `appendEntry`/`registerEntryRenderer` fakes, an optional ctx `model`, and usage-bearing
  assistant stops.

### Event/entry contract (consumed by omo-desktop-app later)

- pi-event `goal_continuation_scheduled`: `{goalId, delayMs, activeMonitorCount, cache?}`.
- pi-event `goal_continuation_resumed`: `{goalId, delayMs, waitedMs, activeMonitorCount, cache?}`.
- Custom session entry `goal-cache-warmup` (`CustomEntry.data = GoalCacheWarmupEntryData`):
  `{phase: "scheduled"|"resumed", goalId, delayMs, waitedMs?, activeMonitorCount, cache?}`,
  `cache = {ttlSeconds?, cachedTokens, estimatedSavedUsd?}`.

### Expected merge conflict zones on the next sync

- LOW in `monitor-continuation.ts` around `#schedule`/`#continueIfEligible` and `index.ts`
  renderer registration.
- NONE in persistence, tool schemas, or status transitions; standalone `pi-goal` has no terminal
  monitor integration.

## Monitor-wait continuation stall check (2026-07-28)

### What changed

- `monitor-continuation.ts` counts consecutive monitor-wait continuations per goal
  (`GOAL_STALL_TOOLLESS_THRESHOLD = 3`). From the third consecutive delayed continuation
  fired while monitors stayed active, the hidden continuation prompt is prefixed with a
  `<goal_monitor_stall_check>` block (`buildMonitorStallNotice` in `prompt.ts`) telling
  the agent the repeated wait looks abnormal and to actively inspect the monitored state
  (bash_output, process health, kill_bash + alternate approach, or the blocked audit)
  before waiting again. A `goal_continuation_scheduled`/stall notice is emitted and a UI
  notice shown when the check is injected.
- The streak resets on every signal that breaks the unattended wait loop: monitor
  completion (`terminal_monitor_state` activeCount 0), a real user prompt
  (`before_agent_start` via the new `noteUserPrompt()`), the goal leaving `active` or
  being replaced (goal id change), the immediate no-monitor continuation path, session
  start, and dispose.
- Coverage: `test/suite/goal-monitor-stall.test.ts` (threshold + all reset paths).

### Expected merge conflict zones on the next sync

- LOW in `monitor-continuation.ts` around `#continueIfEligible` and the monitor-state
  subscription.
- LOW in `prompt.ts` (appended exported builder) and `index.ts` `before_agent_start`.

## Goal continuation guardrails (2026-07-29)

### What changed

- `continuation.ts` now persists the continuation cap as stateful goal metadata and treats
  continued stale signatures and repeated normalized assistant outputs as stop conditions.
  The cap remains 8, stale-signature comparison stays immediate-path only, and a single-flight
  latch prevents duplicate queued continuations.
- `prompt.ts` generalizes the stall notice from monitor-only to goal-wide: the same
  continuation block now covers toolless continuation streaks from the 3rd consecutive turn,
  uses `<goal_stall_check>` for the renamed block, keeps the monitor-flavored bullets when
  monitors are active, and emits generic recovery bullets otherwise. The user-prompt grace
  delay remains 60s, truncation recovery remains one minimal prompt, and terminal provider
  errors now block the goal when `AgentEndEvent.willRetry` is false.
- `monitor-continuation.ts`, `lifecycle-helpers.ts`, and `index.ts` route immediate,
  monitor-delayed, and session-start continuation entry points through the verdict engine;
  user prompts reset the streak state, and the session-start admission path suppresses
  resumed flooded sessions with 8+ historical trailing continuation entries.
- `types.ts` and persistence/store code now carry the continuation streak and signature
  fields so a restart cannot bypass the cap, while the existing `tokenBudget` field stays
  inert compatibility metadata only.

### Why

- The built-in goal feature had multiple independent loop sources: repeated clean agent turns,
  stale hidden control prompts after state changes, immediate re-entry after a real user turn,
  truncation loops, silent provider terminal failures, and resumed sessions that replayed long
  continuation histories. These guards close those paths without introducing budget-based policy.

### Expected merge conflict zones on the next sync

- HIGH in `continuation.ts`, `monitor-continuation.ts`, `lifecycle-helpers.ts`, and `index.ts`
  where continuation admission and reset state are wired.
- MEDIUM in `prompt.ts` and the goal store/persistence files for the new guard state.
- LOW in `extensions/types.ts` and related core event plumbing for `AgentEndEvent.willRetry`.

## Blank reasons treated as omitted for update_goal complete (2026-07-28)

### What changed

- `tool-registration.ts` normalizes `reason` at the model boundary (trim, non-string
  treated as absent) before validating. An empty, whitespace-only, or null `reason`
  no longer triggers "reason must not be provided when status is complete" — strict
  tool-calling providers that serialize omitted optional strings as `""`/`null`
  previously hit that rejection on every retry and spun. A non-empty reason remains
  rejected for `complete`; `blocked` still requires a non-blank reason.

### Expected merge conflict zones on the next sync

- LOW in `tool-registration.ts` around the update_goal execute validation.

## Continuity across newer user instructions (2026-07-28)

### What changed

- Rewrote the existing continuation prompt guidance so a newer user message
  amends only the active objective's conflicting parts and preserves
  non-conflicting work. An explicit replacement or redirect remains a full
  objective override.

### Expected merge conflict zones on the next sync

- LOW in `prompt.ts` if the standalone goal continuation wording changes.

## Overview
Persistent per-thread goal tracking as an in-tree builtin. Ports the standalone
`pi-goal` extension into senpi with no dependency on it, file-based persistence,
codex-aligned tool naming, and budget-driven behavior removed. An optional
`tokenBudget` is retained only as inert persistence/wire compatibility metadata.

## Elapsed ticker skips unchanged footer labels (2026-07-28)

### What changed
- `GoalElapsedTicker` remembers the last rendered `formatGoalElapsedSeconds()` label and does not call `setStatus`
  again until that visible label changes. `sync()` clears the memo before its promised immediate render, so switching
  active goals or snapshots still repaints even when their formatted elapsed labels match; `stop()` also clears it.
- The ticker still samples once per second. Seconds remain live below one minute; minute/hour/day labels refresh at
  their actual display boundary instead of repainting identical text every second.

### Why
- After one minute, `formatGoalElapsedSeconds()` intentionally omits seconds. The previous ticker nevertheless
  requested a full TUI render every second, producing up to 59 redundant renders per visible minute and compounding
  the cost of large resumed histories.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync
- LOW in `elapsed-ticker.ts` around `sync()`, `tick()`, and lifecycle reset.
- LOW in `goal-elapsed-ticker.test.ts` around fake-timer render expectations.

## Decisive completion/blocked audits + todo completion gate (2026-07-28)

### What changed
- New `todo-gate.ts`: `openTodoTaskContents(entries)` reads the thread's latest todo phases (todotools
  `senpi.todo-state` entries / todo tool results via `getLatestPhasesFromBranchEntries`) and returns every
  non-terminal task; `openTodoCompletionError` renders the rejection message.
- `tool-registration.ts`: `update_goal {status:"complete"}` now throws while any todo task is `pending` or
  `in_progress`, naming the open tasks. `blocked` is not gated. The `update_goal` description was rewritten:
  completion requires the completion audit and is rejected while todos are open, a passing audit must call the
  tool in that same turn, and blocking demands an unmistakably clear impasse recurring for 3+ consecutive goal
  turns.
- `prompt.ts`: `buildContinuationPrompt` restructured (codex `ext/goal` continuation.md alignment, budget-free):
  Continuation behavior (objective stays intact; open todos are remaining goal work; every goal turn ends in a
  concrete action or an `update_goal` call — never a bare status narration), a Completion audit that is decisive
  in BOTH directions (uncertainty keeps working; a fully passing audit must flip to `update_goal complete` in the
  same turn), and a new conservative Blocked audit (self-question for an unmistakable impasse, three-consecutive-
  turn recurrence, never for hard/slow/uncertain work).

### Why
- Observed in real sessions (e.g. 95 `goal-continuation` entries against 2 `update_goal` calls) and reported via
  Discord: the agent loops "all done"/status narration forever without completing the goal, and abandons open
  todo items when new instructions arrive. The old prompt framed completion only as dangerous with no
  counterweight, had no blocked audit, and knew nothing about todos.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this differently
- The gate reads todo state through the public `ctx.sessionManager.getBranch()` surface, mirroring
  `compaction/todo-bridge.ts`; no core change.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync
- MEDIUM in `prompt.ts` and the `update_goal` description if standalone `pi-goal` reworks its prompt; the
  standalone package still ships the old prompt and needs the same rewrite plus todo gate on its next sync
  (its host has no todotools builtin, so the gate needs a host-capability check there).
- LOW in `tool-registration.ts` around the complete branch and `todo-gate.ts` imports.

## Four-minute continuation cadence while monitors are live (2026-07-28)

### What changed
- New `monitor-continuation.ts` owns monitor-aware goal continuation timing. A clean
  `agent_end` still queues immediately when no terminal monitor is live; while one
  or more monitors are live, it schedules one continuation for 240 seconds later.
- Repeated clean turns share one timer. Monitor settlement, goal pause/block/complete,
  pending messages at the boundary, session reload, and session shutdown cancel or
  suppress stale delayed work.
- Scheduling emits `goal_continuation_scheduled` on `pi.events` and calls
  `ctx.ui.notify`, so the classic TUI and RPC `extension_ui_request{method:"notify"}`
  clients receive the same informational notice.

### Why
- Monitor-driven work already wakes the session when decisive output arrives. Queuing
  a goal continuation after every clean turn created tight agent loops while the
  monitor was still waiting; a four-minute cadence keeps the goal alive without
  repeatedly consuming turns.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync
- MEDIUM in `index.ts` around `session_start`, `agent_end`, `refreshGoalUi`, and
  `session_shutdown` lifecycle wiring.
- LOW in the new `monitor-continuation.ts`; the standalone `pi-goal` package has no
  terminal monitor integration today.
- NONE in persistence, tool schemas, status transitions, or public extension types.

## App-server token budget compatibility metadata (2026-07-19)

### What changed
- `Goal.tokenBudget?: number` is accepted when reading stored goals so the app-server adapter can preserve Codex's
  required nullable `ThreadGoal.tokenBudget` wire member.
- The builtin goal tools and continuation engine remain budget-free: they do not create, update, enforce, or react to
  this metadata.

### Why
- Codex's app-server goal shape always includes `tokenBudget`, while older Senpi goal files have no such field. Keeping
  it optional in persistence supports both formats without adding budget statuses, continuations, or transitions.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync
- LOW in `types.ts` and `store.ts` around the additive compatibility field and stored-goal parser.
- NONE in the tool schemas, continuation policy, usage accounting, or status model.

## Mid-turn token usage accounting via message_end (2026-07-20)

### What changed
- New `turn-usage.ts`: `TurnUsageTracker` accumulates assistant usage from `message_end` events
  (`pending`), tracks what mid-turn checkpoints already stored (`flushed`), and at `agent_end` accounts
  only `collectAssistantUsage(messages) - flushed` (clamped per field) so nothing is double counted.
- `index.ts`: subscribes to `message_end`, resets the tracker on `agent_start`, and
  `accountCurrentAgentTurn(ctx, mode, agentRunMessages?)` now sources usage from the tracker
  (pending for mid-turn checkpoints, remaining for `agent_end`) instead of taking a usage argument.
  `beginAgentGoalAccounting` discards pending usage when a new accounting window opens so a goal
  created or replaced mid-turn is not charged tokens streamed before it existed (matching the
  existing time-window semantics).
- `tool-registration.ts` / `command-registration.ts`: `accountCurrentAgentTurn` deps drop the
  `EMPTY_USAGE` argument; `get_goal` checkpoints before reading so its snapshot carries fresh
  tokens and elapsed time.

### Why
- Long goal-driven runs complete inside one agent turn; usage was only harvested at `agent_end`,
  so `update_goal`/`get_goal` reported `tokensUsed: 0` after hours of work (observed: a completed
  goal reporting `tokensUsed: 0, timeUsedSeconds: 6652` while the session had consumed ~379K tokens).

### Why extension system couldn't handle this differently
- `message_end` already delivers each finalized assistant message with usage through the public
  `pi.on` API; the fix is entirely builtin-local with no core change.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync
- MEDIUM in `index.ts` around `accountCurrentAgentTurn`/`agent_end` if standalone `pi-goal`
  reworks usage accounting; the standalone package needs the same tracker on its next sync.
- LOW in `tool-registration.ts`/`command-registration.ts` deps signatures.

## Live elapsed footer ticker (2026-07-17)

### What changed
- New `elapsed-ticker.ts`: `GoalElapsedTicker` drives a once-per-second footer refresh, plus the pure
  `goalLiveElapsedSeconds(goal, measuredFromMs, nowMs)` helper (committed `timeUsedSeconds` + whole seconds since
  the current measurement window opened, mirroring `accountCurrentAgentTurn`'s rounding).
- `ui.ts`: `goalStatusText`/`updateGoalUi` accept an optional `liveElapsedSeconds`; when present, an active goal
  renders `Pursuing goal (…)` from the live value (including `0s`) instead of the frozen `timeUsedSeconds`.
- `index.ts`: added `refreshGoalUi` — while `ctx.hasUI` and the goal is `active` with a matching open accounting
  window, it syncs the ticker (live refresh); otherwise it stops the ticker and falls back to a static
  `updateGoalUi`. The ticker is stopped on pause/complete/clear and `session_shutdown`. `refreshGoalUi` is injected
  into `command-registration.ts` and `tool-registration.ts`, replacing their direct `updateGoalUi` calls.

### Why
- The footer showed a stale `Pursuing goal (…)` (or no time at all on a fresh goal) because `timeUsedSeconds` only
  advances at `agent_end`/`session_shutdown`/`/goal` checkpoints and the footer was only re-set at those same
  points. Users pursuing a goal saw the elapsed time freeze instead of ticking live.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this differently
- `setStatus` is fire-and-forget with no scheduler; the per-second refresh must be owned by the builtin. It is
  implemented entirely via the public `pi.*` API + `ctx.ui.setStatus`; no core change.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync
- LOW in `ui.ts`/`index.ts` if standalone `pi-goal` restyles the footer or refactors UI wiring.
- The standalone `pi-goal` package needs the same ticker on its next sync (it shares this `ui.ts`/`format.ts` shape).

## Atomic goal store and narrow stale-brace recovery (2026-07-10)

### What changed
- Fork-specific divergence from standalone `pi-goal`: `store.ts` writes complete JSON to a unique sibling temporary
  file with mode `0600`, then atomically renames it over the destination and cleans up the temporary file on failure.
- Goal reads recover only the observed corruption shape: one complete root JSON object followed solely by whitespace
  and one or more stale closing braces. Truncated JSON, arbitrary trailing bytes, unsupported versions, and invalid
  goal shapes still fail normally.

### Why this belongs in the builtin
- The persistence path, file format, and recovery boundary are private to the vendored goal builtin. Keeping this
  fork-specific behavior in `goal/store.ts` protects session resume without broadening shared session storage or the
  public extension API.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync
- HIGH in `store.ts` for standalone `pi-goal` changes to imports, temporary-file handling, `writeGoal`,
  `parseGoalFile`, or malformed JSON recovery.
- MEDIUM in goal store tests covering persistence and malformed JSON behavior.
- NONE in shared core session storage and `extensions/types.ts`, which this divergence does not touch.

## Continuation halts on aborts and terminal turns (2026-06-21)

### What changed
- `continuation.ts`: goal continuation no longer re-prompts after a tool call was aborted, and stops after terminal
  turns instead of nudging a finished conversation.
- `index.ts` split registration into `command-registration.ts` / `tool-registration.ts` alongside the continuation
  fix.

### Why
- Continuation nudges after a user abort or a terminal turn fought the user's intent and could loop the session.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this differently
- Continuation is this builtin's own `pi.*`-API logic; no core change involved.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync
- NONE upstream (fork-native builtin); internal file split only matters for future vendored pi-goal syncs.

## Initial port — budget-free, file-based goal builtin (2026-06-15)

### What changed
- New builtin extension `goal` (`builtin/goal/`), registered last in
  `builtin/index.ts` `builtinExtensions`. Exposes `create_goal`, `update_goal`,
  `get_goal` and the `/goal` command.
- Ported from `code-yeongyu/pi-goal` (`src/goal/*`) module-for-module:
  `store`, `types`, `validation`, `continuation`, `prompt`, `format`, `command`,
  `errors`, `index`. No runtime or dev dependency on `pi-goal`.
- File-based persistence retained: `GoalFile{version:1, goal}` under
  `<sessionDir>/extensions/goal/<threadId>.json`, with a
  `getAgentDir()/extensions/goal/no-session/<sha256(cwd)[:24]>` fallback.

### Budget removal (the deliberate divergence)
- Dropped the `token_budget` create param and initially dropped the `Goal.tokenBudget` field. The optional field was
  later reintroduced solely as inert app-server persistence/wire compatibility metadata; the create tool still has no
  budget parameter.
- Dropped the `budgetLimited` status; `GoalStatus` is now `active|paused|complete`.
- Removed `validateTokenBudget`, the budget-limit continuation prompt, the
  `goal-budget-limit` message type, and every budget-driven status transition
  (`statusAfterBudgetLimit`/`statusAfterAccounting` budget branches).
- `GoalAccountingMode` collapsed to `active | activeOrComplete`; `accountGoalUsage`
  only increments `tokensUsed`/`timeUsedSeconds` and never changes status.
- Tool descriptions and the continuation prompt rewritten to drop budget language
  (the `get_goal` "budgets / remaining token budget" wording, the create
  "token budget" lines, the update "budget-limit" lines).

### Senpi adaptations vs upstream pi-goal
- Imports `getAgentDir()` from `src/config.ts` (env `SENPI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`,
  fallback `~/.senpi/agent`) instead of pi-goal's `.pi` agent dir.
- Tool error results are signaled by throwing from `execute()`; senpi's
  `AgentToolResult` has no `isError` field and the agent loop only marks an error
  on throw (`agent-loop.ts` `executePreparedToolCall`).
- UI simplified to a single `ctx.ui.setStatus("goal", …)` footer segment instead
  of pi-goal's full footer-replacement component.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this differently
- Implemented entirely as a builtin extension via the public `pi.*` API
  (`registerTool`, `registerCommand`, `pi.on`, `sendMessage`) plus the
  `getAgentDir()` config helper. No change to `extensions/types.ts` or other core.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync
- LOW: `builtin/index.ts` import block + `builtinExtensions` array if upstream
  reorders or adds builtins.
- NONE for `extensions/types.ts` (untouched).

## Sync from pi-goal 0.3.0 (2026-07-26)

### Source

- Canonical source: `code-yeongyu/pi-goal` 0.3.0, merged by
  [pi-goal PR #1](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/pi-goal/pull/1).
- Version metadata was regenerated through `sync-builtin-extensions.mjs`; this
  builtin remains a manual-merge package because of senpi-only structure.

### What changed

- Imported the blocked lifecycle (`blockedReason`/`blockedAt`), model-only
  blocked/complete transitions, and blocked continuation suppression.
- `create_goal` now replaces a completed goal after JSONL archival; oversized
  objectives are marker-budget truncated and preserve their full text in a
  per-thread spill file.
- Aligned tool schemas and guidance with the 4,000-character, complete-replace,
  and blocked-audit contract while retaining budget-free behavior.

### Senpi conflict zone: abort detection

- Standalone pi-goal 0.3.0 captures `ctx.signal` and treats any aborted signal
  as a user interruption. Senpi deliberately does not retain that heuristic:
  todo 11 supplies an internal agent-end aborted flag so only a real user abort
  blocks an active goal.
- Follow up upstream: add an aborted flag and source to the published extension
  API so standalone pi-goal can remove its `ctx.signal` heuristic too.

### Expected merge conflict zones on the next sync

- HIGH: `store.ts`/`persistence.ts` retain senpi's atomic writes and stale-brace
  recovery while upstream owns the lifecycle persistence semantics.
- MEDIUM: `index.ts`, `tool-registration.ts`, and `ui.ts` retain senpi's split
  registration, elapsed ticker, and core abort-event integration.

## Reload no longer auto-starts a stopped goal; gap-abort blocks active goal (2026-07-27)

### What changed
- `index.ts` session_start handler: `queueGoalContinuation` is now gated on `event.reason !== "reload"`.
  A config reload emits `session_start` with reason `"reload"` (agent-session.ts reload()). Previously this
  queued a hidden continuation prompt for any active goal, auto-starting an agent the user had stopped.
  Now reload only reloads; startup/resume/new/fork keep existing continuation behavior.
- `types.ts`: new `SessionAbortEvent` (`type: "session_abort"`) added to the `SessionEvent` union and
  `ExtensionAPI.on()` overloads.
- `agent-session.ts`: `abort()` now captures gap-state before `_abortActiveAgentAndRetry` resets retry
  counters, and emits `session_abort` (via both `_extensionRunner.emit` and `this._emit`) when the gap case
  is detected: `retryAttempt > 0` (retry backoff — the error agent_end already fired, agent.abort() is a no-op,
  no new agent_end with abortSource "user" will reach extensions), or `!isStreaming && (isCompacting || pendingMessageCount > 0)`.
  Mid-run aborts (`isStreaming && retryAttempt === 0`) are excluded — agent_end owns those. Purely-idle
  defensive aborts (e.g. RPC session-registry closeMarked on an idle session) are excluded.
- `index.ts` new `session_abort` handler: accounts the current agent turn (mode "active"), then if the goal
  is still active, transitions it to `blocked` with reason `"user interrupted the turn"`, clears accounting,
  and refreshes the UI.

### Why
- A user-abort that stops in-flight work outside an active LLM run (retry backoff, compaction, queued
  continuation) left the goal `active` because `_agentAbortSource` is set only when `isStreaming`, and the
  earlier error `agent_end` had no abortSource. The goal then auto-restarted on config reload (bug 1) or
  session resume, contradicting the user's explicit stop.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync
- LOW in `types.ts` around the `SessionEvent` union and `on()` overloads (additive).
- LOW in `agent-session.ts` around `abort()` and the `AgentSessionEvent` union (additive).
- LOW in `goal/index.ts` around the session_start handler and the new session_abort handler.

## 2026-08-20 — tickers retire on stale extension contexts

`GoalWaitTicker`/`GoalElapsedTicker` previously relied on `index.ts` render
callbacks that swallowed the stale-ctx error thrown after session
replacement/reload, so a ticker holding a retired ctx kept ticking forever
while rendering nothing — the footer elapsed/countdown froze and the TUI lost
its only periodic repaint source in idle sessions. Both tickers now detect the
stale-ctx error (`stale-context.ts`) inside `tick()` and retire (clear the
interval, drop the ctx); `GoalWaitTicker.stop()` tolerates a stale ctx on its
final clear render. A later `sync()` with a live ctx re-arms them. Covered by
`test/suite/goal-ticker-stale-context.test.ts`.

## 2026-09-24 — Goal cache-warm consumes the prompt-cache lifetime classification (#831, #2090)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/cache-warm.ts` reads `resolvePromptCacheLifetime()`. For a best-effort cache, `estimateCacheWarmMetrics()` reports `cacheLifetime: "best-effort"` with the cached tokens and no `ttlSeconds` or savings estimate, and the new `resolveGoalBackstopMaxSecondsForCache()` replaces an unconfigured (270 s default) backstop with `GOAL_MONITOR_BEST_EFFORT_BACKSTOP_SECONDS` (3570). An explicitly configured backstop other than the default is kept. Explicit-TTL and unknown lanes are unchanged.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/monitor-continuation.ts` passes the active model's lifetime into the backstop resolution when a monitor wait is scheduled.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/cache-warm-renderer.ts` renders a best-effort card as "~N tokens were cached after the prior turn · provider caching is best-effort, with no expiry to beat", without TTL, warmth, or savings copy.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/goal/parked-wait.ts` restores the `cacheLifetime` marker when a reload re-arms a parked wait.

### Why

- The 270 s default backstop exists to land the re-check inside a 5-minute TTL. A best-effort cache (direct DeepSeek) has no TTL, so that wake only preserved a fabricated expiry and the card claimed a "5m prompt-cache TTL". Explicit-TTL lanes now show their real TTL (30m for OpenAI GPT-5.6+/GPT-6).

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The Goal extension owns the monitor timer, the `goal-cache-warmup` entry/event payload and its renderer; no other extension can change the delay or copy after scheduling.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `cache-warm.ts` backstop constants and metrics function, the delay expression in `monitor-continuation.ts` `#schedule()`, the `warmLine()` branch in `cache-warm-renderer.ts`, and `parseCache()` in `parked-wait.ts`.
