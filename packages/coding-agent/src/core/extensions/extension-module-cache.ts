/**
 * Process-wide cache for compiled extension module graphs.
 *
 * A module registry has no eviction API, so every extension source evaluated under a fresh
 * importer generation stays resident for the life of the process. A daemon that loads extensions
 * per session therefore pays that cost per session forever (senpi#1948). The graph is a pure
 * function of its source files, so this cache keeps ONE live generation and hands the same factory
 * to every later load whose sources are byte-for-byte unchanged; every load still runs the factory,
 * so sessions keep their own extension instances.
 *
 * Freshness is preserved by invalidation: a changed, added or removed source file drops the
 * generation, and the next load compiles a new one. An importer that cannot report the files it
 * compiled (the Node jiti path) is never cached, because its graph cannot be checked for staleness.
 *
