# packages/coding-agent/src/modes/rpc

JSONL-over-stdio RPC mode for driving Senpi sessions programmatically (TUI-less). One UTF-8 JSON object per LF-delimited line; requests in, events out. The public protocol reference is `packages/coding-agent/docs/rpc.md`.

## COMMAND-SURFACE LIFECYCLE

- On bind/rebind, `connection-handler.ts` builds the ordered `RpcSlashCommand` snapshot and digests it (`rpc-command-surface.ts`).
- The baseline digest starts `undefined`: the first snapshot is recorded WITHOUT emitting `commands_changed`. That baseline suppression is intentional (it removed the initial client-refresh feedback loop) — do not "fix" it into an emission.
- `commands_changed` fires only when a later snapshot differs (extension reload, rebind, config change); clients refetch via `get_commands`.
- `command_invocation` / `skill_invocation` are additive typed metadata on prompt events; they do not replace `loaded_surfaces_changed` / `get_loaded_surfaces`.
- Skill expansion (`$name`, `$skill:name`) happens in prompt preprocessing and must not reset or reorder MCP loaded surfaces.

## INVARIANTS

- Framing is strict LF. Records over `MAX_RPC_LINE_CHARACTERS` are dropped with resynchronization rather than killing the stream; preserve that recovery behavior.
- Inbound messages over `MAX_RPC_MESSAGE_CHARACTERS` are rejected with a typed error; non-object JSON is rejected.
- Pending work is rejected on disconnect or child exit; preserve request/response correlation.
- Child stderr is emitted and embedded raw; treat diagnostics as secret-bearing.

### Shared-daemon invariants (I1-I4)

One host per endpoint; a client may run many endpoints under one agent dir (omo runs one per parent session, the Desktop one per thread, under `rpc/shards/`); every invariant below holds per endpoint, for every surface that touches it - CLI, desktop, task runner:

- **I1** — never terminate, signal or replace a host this process did not start. A mismatch ends in `refuse`, never in a second host bound over somebody else's endpoint. The only carve-outs are `stopHost` against a validated own-writer pidfile with zero foreign attached/retained sessions (or explicit `force`), and a drain, which ends no work. A handoff may also bind over an IDLE host that no registration proves (#2701): that host is never signalled - it drains itself on losing the public entry - and a busy one is refused.
- **I2** — compatibility is `protocolVersion` + capabilities, never a version-string comparison. An uncomparable `engineOrdinal` is EQUAL, and a handoff needs STRICTLY greater, so an unknown-age build attaches instead of upgrading.
- **I3** — only the owning generation writes its daemon state; everyone else reads. Clients fail CLOSED (report, or start their own private host) and never edit, unlink or delete another generation's files, socket or pidfile. Layout 2 deliberately writes no flat `host.pid`, which is what makes pre-layout-2 clients fail closed instead of taking the daemon over. An ensure may claim `owner.json` only for the matching serving generation, under the endpoint lock and attach hold, and only while unowned or after confirmed owner death. The other cross-writer is the stop intent (`host-stop-intent.ts`): whoever is about to signal a generation writes `generations/<instanceId>/stop-intent.json` into THAT generation's directory first, because the target cannot know who is about to stop it; no code reads or removes another generation's intent, the supervisor layers its own step over an outer intent instead of overwriting it, and a drain writes none. Every caller that SIGKILLs a supervisor writes that generation's terminal record into `crashes.jsonl` BEFORE it releases or clears the registration that holds the intent (senpi#2566).
- **Endpoint removal** — `gcEndpoint` (`host-gc.ts`) is the ONLY code that removes an endpoint directory, reached from exactly two entry points on the same evidence: `gcHostEndpoints` (`senpi host gc`) and the budgeted pass `ensureHost` schedules AFTER it returned a host (`host-gc-pass.ts`: detached and unref'd, never awaited by the ensure, outside every lock, at most once per 5 min per agent dir, 1.5 s / 32 endpoints, a fair rotation resumed after the marker's cursor, uncollectable endpoints skipped with a 10 min to 24 h backoff, the ensure's own endpoint never judged). It removes an endpoint directory (`endpoint.json` included), its socket or its `.next-*`/`.shield-*` siblings, and only on the three-part evidence read INSIDE that socket's ensure lock (`hostEnsureLockTarget`): no live generation pidfile (the pointer's generation included), no live claim owner, a socket that refuses or is absent (successor binds included). It removes siblings, then the socket, then the directory LAST (a failed removal stays listed for the next gc), leaves a directory-typed sibling in place (`skipped`), and records one endpoint's failure as `failed` without stopping the run. It never signals, never runs inside the ensure lock or `status`, and never touches a layout-1 flat directory or a directory whose socket nothing names.
- **I4** — worker sessions are invisible by default: `kind: "worker"` rows need `include_workers: true`, `context` is published on that listing only, and their `session_closed`/`session_parked` records go to attached connections only.
- **Endpoint kinds** — a `tui` endpoint (a terminal's control socket, `t-<16hex>.sock`) is owned by its terminal process. `runHostRequest` refuses `ensure`/`handoff`/`stop` against one with `unsupported_endpoint_kind` (exit 3) from `endpoint.json` or the socket name alone, BEFORE any connection; `status --all` sends it `get_protocol_info` + `list_sessions` only and reports `owner`; `gc` reaps a dead one on the same three-part evidence. `alive` is judged from the socket's own `get_protocol_info` answer (`probeHostStatus().answered`), never from the recorded generation the report falls back to.
- **Wake** — `wake` on a host session has the terminal endpoint's contract: one `WakeScheduler` pass, answered with its `{ admitted }`; no registered drain answers `admitted: []`. A host session's registration binds nothing (the host socket is the endpoint) and is `unsupported_mode` without a public `host_socket`.
- **Release** — `release_session` is the only way a host gives a live session's file to another writer, and only a QUIET session: no run, no prompt in preflight (`binding.pendingPrompts`), no unwritten admitted delivery, no bash/compaction/barrier work (the handoff fields), and no OTHER in-flight router request for the session (`activeRequests` minus the release). `isStreaming` alone is not enough - a user bash and a prompt in preflight both write after it. Only the FINAL check, `externalAdmission.close()` and the close claim are one synchronous step (an `interrupt` release awaits before it) - a drain pass still running cannot admit into a session being torn down. `interrupt` empties the queues first (`clearQueue`) and answers what it took in `dropped { deliveries, user_messages }` - on success AND on every refusal after it, which also reopens admission (`try/finally` in `releaseSession`): queued input never vanishes silently and a refused release never leaves admission closed; a `queued` refusal carries `retry_with: { interrupt: true }`; a throw after admission closes (the entry write, the teardown) is answered `release_failed { detail, interrupted?, dropped? }` and reopens admission - the release entry is written with `appendCustomEntry`, and a failed append keeps nothing in memory, so a failed write leaves no phantom entry; a refusal without `interrupt` (`turn_active`, `session_busy`, `attached`, `release_unsupported`, `host_draining`) changes nothing; attached clients are told `session_closed { reason: "released" }`, never `session_parked` (reopening the path on the host would make a second writer).

### The no-sync rule

- The in-process runtime puts every session on ONE loop: a synchronous wait taken on the session path is an outage for every client. `execSync`, `execFileSync`, `spawnSync`, `Bun.spawnSync`, `Bun.sleepSync` and `Atomics.wait` are banned on that call graph; `test/suite/no-sync-in-session-path.test.ts` fails on any call site the checked-in ledger does not already record, and reports sync fs against the same ledger.
- The in-process path has NO session cap. If a change makes the shared daemon refuse an `open_session` for occupancy, it is a defect, not a policy - `too_many_sessions` belongs to `worker-session-registry.ts` alone. Memory never refuses an open either (senpi#2207): each endpoint reports its own pressure and halves idle parking, while every pressured endpoint still admits worker opens. `host status --all` exposes `rss_mb` for the endpoint process tree and `host_rss_mb` for its supervisor plus host; never turn either measurement into an admission gate.
- The socket dead-peer budget counts loop-SERVED time (`loop-blocked-time.ts`): a host stall must never cut a live peer. A session's provider scope closes only after its disposal settles (`session-teardown.ts`), and a config-reload callback bound to a closed scope is a no-op (`session-scoped-callback.ts`).
- Capacity is memory and threads: roughly 1 thread / 2 fds / 5-8 MB per open session, the thread coming from the `config-reload` builtin's per-session watch Worker (senpi#1794). Never claim it is flat.

## VALIDATION

- Focused tests live in `packages/coding-agent/test/rpc-*.test.ts` (rpc-jsonl, rpc-input-validation, rpc-command-invocation, rpc-commands-changed, rpc-multi-session-input, rpc-loaded-surfaces, rpc-classic-compat, rpc-prompt-response-semantics).
- Daemon suites: `test/suite/host-cli*.test.ts`, `test/rpc-host-ensure.test.ts`, `test/rpc-host-handoff.test.ts`, `test/suite/no-sync-in-session-path.test.ts`, `test/suite/rpc-inprocess-host*.test.ts`, `test/suite/rpc-session-context.test.ts`, `test/suite/rpc-retain-on-disconnect.test.ts`, `test/suite/rpc-loop-lag-watchdog.test.ts`, `test/suite/rpc-host-reaper.test.ts`, `test/suite/rpc-worker-capacity.test.ts`. Suites that spawn a host use `test/helpers/spawned-host-reaper.ts`; after any run `pgrep -f rpc-host-fixture.mjs | wc -l` must print 0.
- End-to-end scenarios: `.agents/skills/senpi-qa/scripts/scenarios/dollar-skill-invocation-qa.mjs` and `rpc-input-hardening-qa.mjs`.
- Live daemon QA (POSIX, sandbox agent dir, one JSON line per step, cleanup receipt last): `scripts/qa-rpc-socket/inprocess-daemon-qa.mjs` (two compiled generations end to end) and `scripts/qa-rpc-socket/generation-handoff.mjs` (the handoff alone).
- Behavior changes update `changes.md` here and `docs/rpc.md` in the same increment.
- Runtime changes require root `bun run check` and real CLI QA evidence.
