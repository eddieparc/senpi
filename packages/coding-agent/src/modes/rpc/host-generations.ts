/**
 * Which generations of one daemon are still RUNNING, and what a dead one leaves behind.
 *
 * The daemon directory accumulates a record per generation, and nothing used to remove one: after a
 * handoff, an idle exit or a kill, `generations/<instanceId>/host.pid` stayed, the pointer could go
 * on naming a process nobody runs, and `reservations/` kept claims of hosts that had been gone for
 * days (#1893: the directory described only dead pids while three supervisors were alive). Reading
 * it therefore has to mean pruning it - a record that names a pid nobody is running is not history,
 * it is a lie about what serves this endpoint.
 *
 * Both answers come from files rather than from the socket on purpose: a generation that no longer
 * answers is exactly what an operator is looking for, and a superseded host holding gigabytes
 * cannot be asked how many sessions it has.
