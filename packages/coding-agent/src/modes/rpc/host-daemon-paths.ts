/**
 * WHERE one socket's daemon keeps its state: the per-socket directory, the files inside it, and the
 * modes they are created with.
 *
 * Layout 2 gives every endpoint its own directory, named by the socket it serves:
 *
 *     <agentDir>/rpc-host-daemon/                 the flat directory - shared, and left legacy-empty
 *       layout.json                               { layout: 2, dir } - the only file this build writes here
 *       <sha256(canonical socket)[:16]>/          0700, one per endpoint
 *         endpoint.json                           { layout, registry_version, endpoint_kind, socket, created_at }
 *                                                 - WHICH socket this is, and what serves it
 *         host.pid                                POINTER: { layout, instance_id, generation_dir, writer }
 *         settings.json                           what the supervisor reads at boot
 *         daemon.lock  stderr.log
 *         generations/<instanceId>/               one per generation of this daemon
 *           host.pid  settings.json  scratch/
 *         reservations/                           cross-generation session-path claims
 *
 * The flat directory is deliberately missing the one file every DEPLOYED client looks for. A flat
 * `host.pid` holding `{ pid, processStartTime }` is exactly what arms their kill paths - the desktop's
 * `readManagedHost` -> takeover, and a pre-layout-2 `ensureHost` -> `stopManagedHost` - so writing one
 * would make an un-updated client replace this daemon and end every other client's sessions. Without
 * it both fail CLOSED: they see no host of their own, refuse, and leave the daemon alone. Nothing here
 * ever writes a legacy-shaped file, and nothing here ever removes one: a flat `host.pid` that DOES
 * exist belongs to a legacy host that may still be running, and is read-only to this build.
 *
 * `endpoint.json` is the endpoint's durable identity: written once and whole (linked into place), never
 * rewritten while it names this directory's socket (an ensure repairs one that does not), and the one file
 * a generation's release leaves behind - so an endpoint whose host exited (cleanly or not) can still
 * be enumerated and named. The pointer, `settings.json` and the generation directories all describe
 * a LIVE host and go with it. `endpoint_kind` says what serves the socket - a multi-session host
 * (`rpc_host`) or a terminal's control endpoint (`tui`) - and a record written before the field
 * existed is read as `rpc_host`; readers never rewrite one to add it.
 *
 * What those files CONTAIN is `host-daemon-state.ts` (settings, and the primitives every state file
 * is written through) and `host-daemon-registration.ts` (the pointer and the generation records).
