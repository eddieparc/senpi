/**
 * The `custom_unsupported` capability gate (plan tasks 13/14).
 *
 * In RPC mode `ctx.ui.custom` cannot render a third-party component — there is no
 * TUI to render it FROM. Historically it returned `undefined` synchronously with
 * NO wire message, so a default RPC client saw nothing at all. A client that
 * can present a native "this extension UI requires the classic TUI" notice opts
 * in via a capability flag.
 *
 * This gate is a PURE function so the additive-only guarantee is unit-provable:
 * only a client that advertised the `custom_unsupported` capability gets the
 * additive `extension_ui_request{method:"custom_unsupported"}` notice; every
 * other (default) client gets `undefined` — byte-identical to the prior
 * behavior, no extra bytes on the wire.
