/**
 * Which session file each generation of the daemon currently holds open.
 *
 * Inside one host process the registry's own reservation set is the authority. Across
 * GENERATIONS it cannot be: during a handoff two hosts are alive at the same time, and the
 * successor must not open a session file the predecessor is still writing - two writers on
 * one JSONL interleave partial records and the transcript is silently corrupted.
 *
 * So every open publishes a small claim next to the daemon state, and every close removes it.
 * A claim is evidence, not a lock: it names the process that made it, so a claim whose owner is
 * gone (a SIGKILLed host, a reboot, a recycled pid with a different start time) is ignored
 * rather than trusted. The failure mode is therefore "a reopen waits ~2s for a live writer to
 * finish", never "a session file can never be opened again".
 *
 * Liveness alone was not enough evidence. A generation that lost the socket stays alive holding
 * retained sessions nobody is attached to, and its claims then refused every reopen of those files
 * for as long as the process existed (#1893). So a claim counts while its owner is the generation
 * the pointer names, or while the owner still has a client attached to that session - and a
 * superseded, attachment-less claim is reclaimable, because the generation that made it has been
 * asked to drain and parks that session as it settles.
