/**
 * What a client does when it finds - or does not find - a host on the shared RPC socket.
 *
 * One machine-wide host serves several client surfaces, so the process on the socket is
 * usually NOT this process's child. Two invariants follow, and this module is where they
 * are decided once instead of in every client:
 *
 *   I1 - never terminate, signal or replace a host you did not start. The only sanctioned
 *        replacement is the drain-based generation handoff, which ends no running work.
 *   I2 - compatibility is `protocolVersion` + capabilities, NEVER a version-string compare,
 *        and "is my build newer?" is `compareEngineOrdinal`, never `serverVersion`. An
 *        ordinal that cannot be compared (a build without git metadata, a host that reports
 *        none) is EQUAL, and since a handoff needs STRICTLY greater, such a pair attaches.
 *
 * The profile rule is the third guard: a handoff additionally requires the candidate's
 * extension set to be a SUPERSET of the running host's. Handing off to a narrower generation
 * would silently drop whatever the running host loaded (an editor plugin, a member bundle)
 * from every session that reopens in the new generation - so a narrower candidate attaches
 * and says so instead.
