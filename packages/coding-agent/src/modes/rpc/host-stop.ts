/**
 * Ending a generation on purpose - the one path where a client may signal a host it did not spawn.
 *
 * Two different acts hide behind "stop the daemon". A DRAIN ends no work: the host stops accepting,
 * finishes what it is doing and exits when it is empty, so it is always permitted against a host
 * that advertises it can survive the signal at all. A HARD STOP ends whatever the host is doing,
 * including the sessions of every other client sharing it, so it is permitted only against a host
 * that reports nothing open - or behind an explicit `force`, which is the operator saying they know.
 *
 * Both are gated on the same proof: the registration must name the process serving THIS socket
 * (pid plus identity guard). An owner nobody can prove is refused rather than signalled (I1). A host
 * from before layout 2 is known only through its flat record (`host-legacy.ts`); that record proves
 * it for a drain, never for a hard stop (#2423).
 *
 * The proof cannot close one race, and `signalGeneration` is where that is handled: a host is free
 * to exit between the moment its identity is proven and the moment the signal is sent - a drained
 * generation reaches its empty-exit within milliseconds of being asked to drain - so the delivery
 * failure ESRCH means "already gone", not "something went wrong", and must never surface as a raw
 * error to a caller that asked for exactly that outcome.
