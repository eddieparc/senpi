// that deadline, which made a client busy for 4 s with >= 16 KB pending (macOS unix
// stream buffers are 8 KB each way) indistinguishable from a dead one: it was cut
// and its sessions were released (#1774). Tens of seconds of no progress at all is
// the liveness signal we actually want; the peer is then cut exactly like a byte
// overflow - fail-closed, it must resync - while the session keeps running.
//
// The budget is loop-SERVED time. While the host's own loop is blocked nobody can
// drain anything, and on unblock the timers phase runs before the pending drain I/O,
// so a wall-clock deadline cut every live peer after a long host stall (#1905). The
// deadline therefore re-arms for whatever blocked time the loop-lag watchdog recorded
// inside its window, and only a window the loop fully served ends in a cut.
