/**
 * Bringing up the SUCCESSOR generation: where it binds, what it is launched with, and the single
 * observation that proves it took the socket over.
 *
 * The successor binds `<public>.next-<gen>` - never the live public path, which it has no right to
 * unlink - and renames its own entry over the public path only while that path still holds the exact
 * socket this handoff was decided against (`--replace <dev>:<ino>`). Its own answer ON THE PUBLIC
 * SOCKET, reporting an `instanceId` different from the generation being replaced, is the only proof
 * the rename landed; an exit instead means it refused to replace a path that changed underneath and
 * left both sockets alone. The predecessor is asked to drain only AFTER that proof and after the
 * successor is registered - whether it may be asked at all was decided in `host-handoff.ts`, which
 * proved the owner and checked that the running host advertises it can survive the signal.
 *
 * A REFUSED handoff leaves the endpoint as it found it: the successor is killed and, once it has
 * exited, its generation record and directory are released, and the boot `settings.json` it
 * overwrote before spawning is put back byte for byte - so neither `status --all` nor the running
 * generation's next restart ever sees the successor that did not happen.
