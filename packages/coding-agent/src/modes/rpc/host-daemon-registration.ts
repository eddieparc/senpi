/**
 * What a running daemon's records SAY, and who is allowed to act on what they say.
 *
 * Two files describe a running daemon, and that split is the point:
 *
 * - the POINTER (`<daemonDir>/host.pid`) names the generation that currently owns the socket, and
 *   carries no `pid` or `processStartTime` key, so a client from before layout 2 can neither parse
 *   it nor derive a pid to signal from it;
 * - `generations/<instanceId>/host.pid` is the RECORD of one generation: which process serves the
 *   socket, which identity guards that pid, which build it runs, and who registered it.
 *
 * Three fields carry the evidence invariant I1 rests on (never terminate, signal or replace a host
 * you did not start), and each exists because a specific mistake is otherwise unprovable:
 *
 * - `processStartTime` - a pid alone is recycled by the OS, so a stale record would authorize a
 *   signal to an unrelated process.
 * - `writer` - the identity of the process that WROTE the record. Only that process may stop the
 *   host it names; anyone else attaches or refuses.
 * - `instance_id` - which generation the pointer is about, so a predecessor draining after a handoff
 *   removes its own directory and leaves the successor's registration alone.
 *
 * Where those files LIVE, and the modes they are written with, belong to `host-daemon-state.ts`;
 * this module reads and writes through its primitives and never builds a path of its own.
