## 2026-10-09 - Windows tree kills no longer use taskkill /T (senpi#2999 follow-up)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/shell.ts`: `killWindowsProcessTree()` builds its `taskkill` arguments with `windowsTreeKillArgs()` from `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core/node`.
  - It reads one bounded synchronous process listing (`listWindowsProcessRowsSync`) and kills the root plus its genuine descendants, pid by pid, with no `/T`.
  - A process counts as a descendant only when it was created at or after the parent it names.
  - A protected OS image or an ancestor of this process in the tree shrinks the kill to the root alone, or to nothing when the root is one of them.
  - Without a listing it falls back to `/T` on the root.
  - It stays synchronous, and keeps the absolute-path launcher candidates and the direct-pid fallback.

### Why

- `taskkill /T` adopts every process whose recorded `ParentProcessId` equals the root's pid. Windows never rewrites that field when a parent exits, and it reuses pids, so after a wraparound an older, unrelated process that names a long-dead parent can be killed with the tree.
- #2353 showed the same pid-reuse adoption take down a CI runner through the WebView cleanup's own walk; #2991 fixed that walk. This applies the same rule to the remaining tree kills.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The kill path is the core bash tool's and the shutdown registry's synchronous teardown, which runs before any extension can intervene.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the body of `killWindowsProcessTree()` and `taskkillHandledTree()` in `shell.ts` (its argument list changed), plus the new import. Upstream still spawns `taskkill /F /T /PID <pid>`; keep the computed argument list.

## 2026-10-08 - Script children inherit runtime options, not caller entry modes (senpi#2599)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/runtime-exec-argv.ts`: shares the existing Node/Bun entry-mode filter outside RPC without changing its filtering contract.

### Why

An eval or print flag belongs to the embedding caller. Passing it before a child script entry replays the caller instead of starting that child; loader and runtime flags still have to reach the child.

### Why an extension could not handle it

Native process launchers construct their command before a child can load an extension.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the shared runtime argument filter and its direct launch-site imports.

## 2026-10-01 - Agent shells get a real `bun` inside a compiled executable (omo#9362)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/shell.ts`: `getShellEnv()` returns its environment through `withBundledBunCommands()`. In a `bun build --compile` executable, that appends a directory to `PATH` holding `bun`/`bunx` scripts (`bun.cmd`/`bunx.cmd` on Windows), which run this executable with `BUN_BE_BUN=1`. Outside a compiled executable the environment is unchanged.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/bundled-bun.ts` (fork-only): detects a compiled executable from `Bun.main` (`/$bunfs/`, `<drive>:\~BUN\`), writes the scripts under `<agentDir>/bundled-bun/<execPath hash>/` with a `tmpdir()` fallback, and appends that directory to `PATH`.

### Why

- Bun Shell runs `bun` as `process.execPath` when `PATH` has no Bun. In a compiled engine that is the engine itself, so an eval cell's `bun test` booted a second agent and returned its reply as exit-0 output, while the bash tool's `/bin/sh` reported `bun: command not found`. The child cannot tell it was meant to be Bun, so the parent has to provide a real `bun`. Appending keeps a user's own Bun first, and `BUN_BE_BUN` is scoped to that one command, so engine self-spawns keep running the engine.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `getShellEnv()` is the environment the built-in bash tool and terminal spawn with, before any extension can intervene; the eval extension reuses the same helper through the public `withBundledBunCommands` export.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `return` of `getShellEnv()` in `shell.ts` and its new import; upstream has no compiled-executable handling there.

## 2026-09-30 - Sync with upstream v0.99.1 (6a4af07d6): tools and shell utilities

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/paths.ts`: `utils/paths.ts`: `isLocalPath` treats `builtin:` as non-local. `utils/paths.ts`: `getFileContentRevision`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/shell.ts`: `utils/shell.ts`: `sanitizeBinaryOutput` body is upstream's single-regex strip. `utils/shell.ts`: SYNC kill path kept (`killWindowsProcessTree`, `killProcessTree`, `killTrackedDetachedChildren`; landmine L32) plus the existing spawn-error (ENOENT/EACCES) guard; the `hasUnsafeDisplayCharacter` fast path stays in front of the upstream regex.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/syntax-highlight.ts`: `utils/syntax-highlight.ts`: `json` joins the eager highlight.js languages. `utils/syntax-highlight.ts`: extensionless highlight.js specifiers.

### Why

Upstream v0.99.1 (6a4af07d6) changed these paths while the fork carries its own behavior; tools and shell utils adopt upstream bash/read fixes and keep fork output shapes and hooks (plan D-15).

### Why an extension could not handle it

Built-in tool execution and shell handling are core tool implementations that extensions call, not replace.

### Expected merge conflict zones

Every path listed above conflicts again where upstream edits the hunks named in its line; the fork-kept constructs named there are the anchors to preserve.

## 2026-09-17 - Detect managed tools by stat, not by spawn (senpi#1781)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/tools-manager.ts`: `commandExists` walks `PATH` and accepts a regular file carrying an exec bit, with a `PATHEXT` candidate list on Windows, instead of running `spawnSync(cmd, ["--version"])`.

### Why

- The probe sat on the interactive startup path through `ensureTool`, costing a process spawn per candidate. The new `tui` timing namespace measured that seam at a median of 11 ms with a 30 ms worst case on a loaded host; stat-ing the same directories answers the same question in about 1 ms and removes the spawn's load sensitivity.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Managed-tool resolution is host infrastructure consumed by the bash and grep tools before extensions run.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `commandExists` and its new `executableCandidates` helper in `tools-manager.ts`.

## 2026-09-15 - Track detached children by process group until the last descendant exits (senpi#1697)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/shell.ts`: the detached-child shutdown registry now stores `{ pid, pgid, leaderExited }` entries keyed by pid instead of bare pids. `trackDetachedChildPid()`/`untrackDetachedChildPid()` keep their signatures and route through that model; new `noteDetachedChildExited()` releases an entry on the leader's exit only when `process.kill(-pgid, 0)` reports the group empty (win32 keeps untrack-on-exit, having no such group); new `pruneTrackedDetachedChildren()` drops drained groups; new `listTrackedDetachedChildren()` exposes frozen copies for diagnostics and tests.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/shell.ts`: `killTrackedDetachedChildren()` prunes first, then SIGKILLs each tracked group (`kill(-pgid)`) and only falls back to `kill(pid)` while the leader is still known to be alive — it no longer reuses `killProcessTree()`'s unconditional direct-pid fallback. It stays synchronous, because shutdown paths call it and then `process.exit()` in the same tick.

### Why

- Detached shells are spawned into their own process group, and background descendants (`sleep 30 &`, `nohup server &`) keep running in that group after the shell exits. Releasing ownership at the leader's exit left those descendants running past shutdown, and re-killing a long-lived tracked pid directly risked signalling an unrelated process after pid reuse ([#1697](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/1697)).

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The registry is a leaf utility shared by the bash tool, hook command runner, and every shutdown path (print, interactive, rpc, multi-session host); extensions run inside the process this registry cleans up after and cannot observe group membership on its behalf.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: the tracked-children block in `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/shell.ts` (upstream carries a plain `Set<number>` with `killProcessTree` per pid); keep the group model and re-apply upstream edits inside it.

## 2026-09-11 - Parse versioned changelog entries for branded sources (senpi#1583)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/changelog.ts`: parses dated version headers and fenced examples safely, compares SemVer and CalVer entries, preserves prerelease suffixes, bounds notifications to the active source version, and de-duplicates repeated versions.

### Why

- Changelog notifications must understand Senpi's CalVer revisions and branded prerelease labels without showing entries from another source or future release.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Parsing and ordering happen inside the host's changelog utility before interactive extensions receive control.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: changelog header parsing and version comparison helpers.

## 2026-09-11 - Add content revisions for file-backed caches

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/paths.ts` adds a SHA-256 file-content revision helper for auth and provider-settings caches.

### Why

- A content change must invalidate a cache even when the filesystem reports unchanged mtime and size.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The revision primitive is shared by core auth storage and provider settings loaders.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/paths.ts` file-revision helpers.

## Canonical identity resolves through the native realpath (2026-09-07)

### What changed

- `paths.ts`: `canonicalizePath` resolves through `realpathSync.native` instead of `realpathSync`. Its contract is unchanged - it still swallows to the raw input on throw, so the callers that use it for identity comparison keep the convenience behaviour they depend on.
- `paths.ts`: `canonicalizePathStrict` is new. It resolves the same way but does not swallow, so a caller that cannot act on an unconfirmed path gets an error instead of its own input handed back. The convenience form keeps every existing caller.

### Why

- Node's JS-implemented `realpathSync` collapses a `..` inside a symlink target lexically, before following the symlink that segment sits behind, so it can answer a path that differs from the one the kernel opens. Two spellings that name one file could therefore compare unequal, and a path that escapes through a symlinked parent could compare as though it did not. `realpathSync.native` (libuv) agrees with the kernel on both platforms measured.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `canonicalizePath` is the identity primitive the loader and trust plumbing call before any extension is constructed, so nothing downstream can correct an answer it has already returned.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the single `realpathSync` call inside `canonicalizePath`; no signature or control-flow change.

## Open-free resolution follows realpath(3) for `.` and `..` (2026-09-07)

### What changed

- `paths.ts`: the walker applies `.` and `..` against the already-resolved prefix and no longer normalizes either the requested path or a link target before traversal. `realpathWithoutOpenStrict` is new: it keeps the missing-descendant tolerance but throws on EACCES, EIO, ELOOP and hop exhaustion instead of returning a guess.

### Why

- Collapsing `..` lexically diverges from realpath(3) whenever the `..` sits in a link target behind another symlink: for `entry -> "jump/../secret"` with `jump -> outside/subdir` the lexical answer is allowed/secret while the I/O reaches outside/secret. A containment policy fed the lexical answer approves one directory while the read leaves it, and an identity key built from it treats one file as two.
- The tolerant contract is right for the classifier and the monitor parent, where a blocked main thread is worse than an approximate answer, and wrong for a policy or identity decision, which needs to fail closed. Hence two functions rather than one.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The resolver is host infrastructure shared by the permission classifier, the terminal monitor registry and the core file tools.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `paths.ts` resolver body and its exports.
- `test/canonical-path-identity.test.ts`, `test/bounded-realpath.test.ts` (new).

## Open-free path resolution and watch-target helpers (2026-09-07)

### What changed

- `paths.ts` gains `realpathWithoutOpen(path)`: realpath(3) semantics with one `lstatSync`/`readlinkSync` per component (`MAX_SYMLINK_HOPS` 40), components from the first missing or unreadable one kept verbatim, never throws. It is the walker `permission-system/external-dir.ts` introduced on 2026-09-06, moved here so the permission parser and `terminal/monitor-registry.ts` share one implementation.
- `fs-watch.ts` gains `canonicalWatchPath(path)` (the win32-only `realpathSync.native` lookup `watchWithErrorHandler` already performed, now reusable) and `probeDirectoryOpenable(directory)` (`opendir` + one `read` + `close` on the async pool, so a caller can bound the open that a synchronous `fs.watch` would otherwise perform on its own thread).

### Why

- Bun's `fs.realpath*` opens every directory it resolves; on a wedged autofs trigger that open never returns and freezes the host main thread. Paths that a model merely mentions must be resolved without `open(2)`; `canonicalizePath` stays realpath-based for startup/config paths that senpi owns.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Both consumers are in-tree: the permission `tool_call` hook (`permission-system/parsers.ts`) and the file-monitor registry (`terminal/monitor-registry.ts`) run on the host itself, and they must derive the same identity string from the same walker. An extension cannot replace the resolution the host performs before its own hook fires.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `paths.ts` import block and the new exported function; `fs-watch.ts` (upstream has no such helpers).

## Keep synchronous Windows process-tree kill; never throw on missing taskkill (2026-09-03)

### What changed

- `shell.ts` keeps the fork's synchronous `killWindowsProcessTree(pid, taskkillPaths)` /
  `killProcessTree` / `killTrackedDetachedChildren` path (`spawnSync` over
  `windowsTaskkillCandidates`). Upstream 7af2d27dc's async `spawn` + `child.once("error")` is not
  adopted because RPC host shutdown and hooks call the killer in the same tick as `process.exit`.
- The ENOENT / spawn-failure guard is already the fork `spawnSync` `result.error` / try-catch
  path: a missing or failed `taskkill` never throws. Regression `6596-taskkill-enoent` is adapted
  to mock `spawnSync` instead of async `spawn`.

### Why

- Adopting upstream's async kill would make shutdown reaping fire-and-forget and leave orphaned
  children. Dropping the ENOENT guard (or leaving the upstream test mocking `spawn`) would crash
  or false-pass when `taskkill` is absent from PATH.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Process-tree kill runs from RPC host shutdown, hooks, and bash abort inside core utilities
  before any extension hook can wrap it.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `shell.ts` import of `spawn` vs `spawnSync`, and the win32 branch of `killProcessTree`.

## Branded build labels never advertise a bogus engine update (2026-09-04)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/version-check.ts`: `isNewerPackageVersion` returns `false` for version pairs it cannot order instead of falling back to string inequality, so branded build labels (for example `omo@c6e7dd7 2026-09-04 10:17 +09:00`) stop advertising an engine update on every startup.

### Why

- A branded distribution injects a free-form `SENPI_BRAND.displayVersion` that no version parser can order against a registry CalVer. The old inequality fallback made every such pair look "newer", showing a false update toast.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The comparison lives in the engine's own update-check utility; extensions cannot replace its semantics.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the tail of `isNewerPackageVersion` in `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/version-check.ts`.

## Fix biome import-order format drift from #1230 (2026-08-31)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/fs-watch.ts` import specifiers reordered by `biome check --write` (type-only `FSWatcher` after `realpathSync`). Formatting only; zero behavior change.

### Why

- #1230 merged with biome format drift on this file, so every subsequent contributor's pre-commit `--write` pass re-fixed it and smuggled the hunk into unrelated commits. Same class as #1231.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Not applicable: repository formatting hygiene, no runtime surface.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `fs-watch.ts` import block only.

## Canonicalize Windows fs.watch paths before watching (2026-08-31)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/fs-watch.ts` resolves existing watch paths with `realpathSync.native()` on Windows before calling `fs.watch()`, keeping the raw path when resolution fails (missing paths still surface through the existing `onError` flow).

### Why

- libuv's Windows fs-event implementation `abort()`s the whole process (`Assertion failed: !_wcsnicmp(filename, dir, dirlen), src\win\fs-event.c:72`) when a watched directory path carries a non-canonical component (8.3 short name, junction) and an incoming event's long-path conversion no longer prefix-matches the stored watch path. Entering a session from the `/resume` selector re-creates the runtime while such watchers are armed, killing the app ([#1229](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/1229)).

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The abort happens inside libuv native code before any JavaScript `error` event fires, and every repository watcher (footer git watchers, theme watcher, config-reload) routes through this shared wrapper.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the `watchWithErrorHandler` body in `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/fs-watch.ts`.

## Utils re-diverge from upstream dcd4619 (2026-08-25)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/shell.ts` keeps `ShellKind` classification, the
  `SENPI_GIT_BASH_PATH` override, and PTY-aware invocation argument selection.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/syntax-highlight.ts` keeps upstream's per-language lazy
  registration but rewrites every import to the extensionless exported subpaths
  (`highlight.js/lib/core`, `highlight.js/lib/languages/*`): the fork pins highlight.js 11, whose
  strict `exports` map rejects upstream's `.js`-suffixed deep paths (written against v10) — the
  exact failure that broke every CI test job on this PR before the rewrite.

### Why

These are fork-owned product surfaces (senpi branding, provider wire behavior, fork runtime features) that upstream does not carry; the sync must re-assert them on top of upstream's tree.

### Why this lives in the fork

The divergence lives in core wiring, package identity, or build plumbing that executes before any extension loads, so no extension hook can express it.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- The import block of `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/syntax-highlight.ts` whenever upstream edits
  its language set (fork must keep extensionless specifiers while highlight.js 11 is pinned).

## Repository audit baseline for the utils tracker (2026-08-17)

### What changed

- This entry is the canonical inventory for the repository-wide changes.md audit (`scripts/audit-changes-md.mjs`, pin
  `914cf1472e715297caa30db4b9535d534a9eb718`, tag v0.84.2). It assigns every audited production path whose exact
  nearest tracker is this file, summarizing each fork delta; the dated history below it remains authoritative for the
  feature narrative. `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/tools-manager.ts` is already covered by the 2026-08-13 entry
  below.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/child-process.ts`: abort-aware `waitForChildProcess` and post-exit stdout drain
  (dated entries below).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/shell.ts`: synchronous Windows process-tree kill, shell-kind resolution for
  persistent terminals, and the sanitize fast path (dated entries below).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/fs-watch.ts`: optional recursive-watch options (2026-07-21 entry below).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/paths.ts`: shared `shortenPath()` display helper (2026-05-24 entry below).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/version-check.ts` and `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/pi-user-agent.ts`:
  brand-aware update channel and outbound identity (own entry below).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/clipboard-image.ts`: equivalent optional-chaining guard on the native image check
  (own entry below).
- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/highlight-js-lib-index.d.ts`: deleted ambient module declaration, with
  `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/syntax-highlight.ts` importing the typed package entry instead (own entry below).

### Why

- The pre-backfill audit reported these paths uncovered because the entries that describe them predate the canonical
  four-section format (their conflict-zone headings carried suffixes) or never named the exact path. This inventory
  closes that gap without rewriting accurate history below.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Tracker coverage is repository policy enforced by repository scripts before any extension loader exists; the paths
  themselves are shared leaf utilities beneath the extension API.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- NONE for this inventory: the tracker merges to `ours` and the path list is pin-relative.

## Brand-aware update channel and outbound identity (2026-08-17)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/version-check.ts`: latest-version checks query the npm registry
  (`registry.npmjs.org` package documents, or a brand update channel's dist-tags endpoint) instead of the engine's
  release site; `readAvailableVersion()` reads whichever document shape was fetched. Version comparison gained a
  Senpi CalVer comparator (`YYYY.M.D` with an optional hotfix component) ahead of the semver fallback, release notes
  link to the senpi changelog tag or the brand's changelog template, and the offline/skip gates read brand-scoped
  environment values. A brand without an update channel skips the check entirely: the engine's own releases are not
  installable from inside a branded distribution.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/pi-user-agent.ts`: the update-check user agent identifies as
  `BRAND?.userAgent ?? APP_NAME` and defaults its version argument to `DISPLAY_VERSION`.

### Why

- `senpi update` and startup update checks must compare against senpi or brand releases, never upstream engine
  releases, and CalVer hotfix segments do not order under plain semver comparison.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Startup version checks run from core utilities before extensions load; an extension cannot redirect the fetch
  target or rewrite the user agent of a check that has already fired.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- MEDIUM: `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/version-check.ts` endpoint selection and version comparator.
- LOW: `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/pi-user-agent.ts` identity line.

## Clipboard native-read equivalent guard (2026-08-17)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/clipboard-image.ts`: the native backend's image check collapsed
  `!clipboard || !clipboard.hasImage()` into the equivalent `!clipboard?.hasImage()`.

### Why

- Optional-chaining parity with the fork's erasable-syntax tree; behavior is unchanged — a missing native backend
  and a backend reporting no image both still return no image.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Clipboard image decoding is a shared leaf utility consumed by core input paths; extensions call into it rather than
  around it.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the single guard line in the native clipboard read.

## Removed highlight.js ambient module declaration (2026-08-17)

### What changed

- Deleted `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/highlight-js-lib-index.d.ts`, the hand-written ambient declaration that
  typed a deep `lib/index.js` import.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/syntax-highlight.ts` imports `hljs` from the package's typed entry point instead,
  so the highlight interface comes from upstream types rather than a fork copy.

### Why

- The declaration existed only to type an untyped deep import; the package entry is typed, and maintaining a fork
  declaration let it drift from the real highlight API.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Module typing is compile-time; extensions cannot supply ambient declarations for the host package build.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the import line in `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/syntax-highlight.ts`; the deletion is clean unless
  upstream edits the removed file.

## Brand-aware offline package management (2026-08-13)

### What changed

- Kept the package manager's offline gate routed through
  `envValue("OFFLINE")` instead of reading `PI_OFFLINE` directly.
- Kept `downloadFile` typed against Node's readable-stream interface rather
  than an untyped response body.

### Why

- Senpi supports branded environment prefixes while retaining upstream
  compatibility, and package downloads need a concrete stream contract.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Package installation and self-update execute before extension loading and own
  the process environment and download pipeline.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `tools-manager.ts`, at the offline environment gate and `downloadFile`
  response-body handling.

## Windows process-tree kill survives an unresolvable taskkill (2026-08-11)

### What changed

- `shell.ts`: the Windows branch of `killProcessTree` moved into `killWindowsProcessTree`, which walks the ordered
  launcher list from the new `windowsTaskkillCandidates` export (every existing absolute `System32` / `Sysnative`
  `taskkill.exe`, then the bare PATH-resolved name), runs each with `spawnSync` under a 5s timeout, and only degrades
  to `process.kill(pid)` when no launcher starts at all. Both new functions are exported for regression coverage.

### Why

- `spawn("taskkill", ...)` resolves the executable through PATH and reports a failed lookup asynchronously on the
  child's `error` event, so the surrounding `try`/`catch` never saw it. On a session whose PATH had lost
  `%SystemRoot%\System32`, `killTrackedDetachedChildren()` during shutdown raised
  `Error: spawn taskkill ENOENT` as an uncaught exception and took the CLI down instead of exiting, and no tracked
  child was killed.
- The kill is synchronous because `emergencyTerminalExit()` calls `killTrackedDetachedChildren()` and then
  `process.exit(129)` in the same tick. An asynchronous killer — or a fallback wired to the child's `error` event —
  never runs on that path, so the tracked child would survive. `spawnSync` reports a failed lookup on its returned
  `error` field instead of emitting it, so ENOENT can no longer become an uncaught exception either.
- The candidate list exists because the reported failure was PATH resolution, not a missing binary: a broken PATH must
  not downgrade a tree kill to a direct kill. `process.kill` maps to `TerminateProcess` and leaves descendants
  orphaned, the same limitation `packages/pty/src/pipe-fallback.ts` documents, so it stays a last resort.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Detached-child bookkeeping and the shutdown signal handlers live in core modes; no extension hook runs inside the
  signal path that kills tracked children.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: the Windows branch of `killProcessTree` and the `node:path` / `child_process` import lines in `shell.ts`.

## Config-reload recursive watch option (2026-07-21)

### What changed

- `fs-watch.ts`: `watchWithErrorHandler` now accepts an additive optional Node `WatchOptions` argument, allowing callers to request recursive directory watches while retaining its existing error handling.

### Why

- The config-reload watch engine watches directories rather than individual files so editor atomic-save rename-replaces remain observable.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- The watcher wrapper is a shared leaf utility used by core and mode code.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: `watchWithErrorHandler` parameter list and `fs.watch` invocation.


## Shell resolution for persistent terminals (2026-07-07)

### What changed

- `shell.ts`: `getShellConfig` honors `SENPI_GIT_BASH_PATH` (checked before Windows Git-Bash
  probing) and resolves an explicit shell path by KIND — `cmd.exe` → `/c`, PowerShell/pwsh →
  `-NoProfile -Command`, bash/sh → `-c`/`-s`. New exports: `resolveShellKind`, `GIT_BASH_PATH_ENV`,
  `ShellKind`, and a `kind` field on `ShellConfig`.

### Why

- The persistent-terminal builtin (`terminal`) resolves the shell + args + transport via this
  helper and passes them into `@earendil-works/pi-pty`, so non-bash shells (cmd, PowerShell)
  and a user-pinned Git Bash spawn correctly on Windows.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Shell resolution is a core utility shared by `core/tools/bash.ts` and the terminal extension.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: `getShellConfig` resolution order and `ShellConfig` shape.

## Pinned update changelog links (2026-06-29)

### What changed

- `version-check.ts`: update notes link to the changelog anchored at the specific released version instead of a
  floating link that could drift after later releases.

### Why

- "What's new" links in the update notice must show the notes for the version being offered.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Update-notice construction is a startup core utility.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: `version-check.ts` release-notes URL formatting.

## Drain delayed child stdout (2026-06-28)

### What changed

- `child-process.ts`: output collection keeps reading delayed descendant stdout after the parent process exits,
  instead of resolving at parent exit and truncating late output (upstream issue #5303).

### Why

- Commands whose descendants hold the pipe past parent exit lost trailing output in tool results.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Child process stream collection is shared core utility code under the bash tool.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- MEDIUM: `child-process.ts` stream-drain/exit-resolution ordering (upstream fixed the same class of bug in
  #5753; expect overlapping hunks).

## Output hot-path fast paths (2026-06-13)

### What changed

- `shell.ts`: `sanitizeBinaryOutput()` returns the input string immediately when it contains no unsafe display
  characters, skipping the per-code-point filter on the (dominant) clean case. RPC-side batching is in
  `../modes/rpc/changes.md` 2026-06-13.

### Why

- Output sanitization showed up on streaming hot paths for large tool outputs.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Sanitization runs inside shared output utilities used by core tools.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: `shell.ts` around `sanitizeBinaryOutput()`.

## Shared path shortening (2026-05-24)

### What changed

- `paths.ts`: `shortenPath()` (`~/…` shortening) is a shared utility used by core and builtins for consistent short display paths. It previously also backed the fork's `/sessions` session-observer HUD picker (builtin `session-observer`), which was removed on 2026-07-26; `shortenPath()` itself stays — other consumers remain.

### Why

- Callers that list paths across `~/.senpi/agent/sessions/` cwd-subdirs need consistent short display paths.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- The helper lives in shared utils so core and builtins format paths identically.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: `paths.ts` helper exports.

## Senpi-branded outbound identity (2026-05-11)

### What changed

- `core/sdk.ts`: `getProviderHeaders()` no longer hardcodes `"pi"` / `"pi-coding-agent"`. The OpenRouter `X-OpenRouter-Title` and the Cloudflare `User-Agent` now interpolate the runtime `APP_NAME` from `config.ts` (`"senpi"` in this fork).

### Why

- Every outbound request should identify as senpi, not pi. Hardcoded `"pi"` strings broke that contract.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- These are core SDK internals; an extension cannot rewrite headers built by `core/sdk.ts`.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: provider-header builder.

## Senpi version metadata lookup (2026-05-02)

### What changed

- `version-check.ts`: Latest-version checks now query the configured senpi package metadata from npm instead of pi.dev.
- `pi-user-agent.ts`: The update-check user agent now uses the runtime app name from package metadata.

### Why

- `senpi update` and startup update checks must compare against senpi releases, not upstream pi-mono releases.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- Startup version checks run from core utilities before extensions can intercept the fetch target.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: version-check URL and user-agent formatting utilities.

## Bash abort/timeout wait release (2026-07-18)

### What changed

- `child-process.ts`: `waitForChildProcess` accepts `options?: { signal?: AbortSignal; abortExitGraceMs?: number }`.
  When the signal aborts (the caller has killed the process and abandoned its output), tail preservation ends: the
  stdio pipes are destroyed so descendants that survived the kill cannot re-arm the post-exit idle grace forever,
  and the wait resolves on `exit` — or after `abortExitGraceMs` (default 5s) when the kill never lands
  (uninterruptible IO, failed `taskkill`).

### Why

- Aborting (ESC) or timing out a bash command killed the process group but completion still waited on
  `waitForChildProcess`, whose pi#5303 idle grace re-arms on every chunk. A daemonized/`detached` descendant that
  escaped the group kill and kept writing into the inherited pipe pinned the tool — and the agent's abort — forever.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- The wait lives inside the core bash tool's local execution backend; no extension hook can release a promise the
  core tool is awaiting.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- MEDIUM: `waitForChildProcess` signature and the listener wiring around the pi#5303 idle-grace logic.

## OpenCode-parity duration formatting (2026-07-22)

### What changed

- `duration.ts`: added `formatDuration`, matching OpenCode's duration display boundaries and rounding behavior.

### Why

- Shared duration displays need the same compact output as OpenCode, including its sub-minute rounding behavior.

### Why extension system couldn't handle this

- `formatDuration` is a leaf utility intended for direct use by core display surfaces.

### Expected merge conflict zones on next upstream sync

- LOW: new `duration.ts` utility and its fork-tracker entry.

## Upstream sync (upstream/main@71dca871) integration repairs (2026-09-12)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/tools-manager.ts`: the offline gate reads `envValue("OFFLINE")` (SENPI_ then PI_ prefix) instead of `process.env.PI_OFFLINE`, and the download stream is typed as `NodeReadableStream<Uint8Array>` instead of `as any`; upstream's musl fd/rg and version lookup changes were adopted.

### Why

- Every environment switch in the fork honors the brand prefix, and the fork lints with `--error-on-warnings`.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Tool download runs during startup before extensions load.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `isOffline()` and the `pipeline(Readable.fromWeb(...))` call.
