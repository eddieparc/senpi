# Using Senpi

This page collects day-to-day usage details that do not fit on the quickstart page.

## Interactive Mode

<p align="center"><img src="images/interactive-mode.png" alt="Interactive Mode" width="600"></p>

The interface has four main areas:

- **Startup header** - shortcuts, loaded context files, prompt templates, skills, and extensions
- **Messages** - user messages, assistant responses, tool calls, tool results, notifications, errors, and extension UI
- **Editor** - where you type; border color indicates the current thinking level
- **Footer** - working directory, session name, token/cache usage, cost, context usage, and current model. Totals include assistant responses, usage reported by tools, and summary generation.

The editor can be replaced temporarily by built-in UI such as `/settings` or by custom extension UI.

### Editor Features

| Feature | How |
|---------|-----|
| File reference | Type `@` to fuzzy-search project files |
| Path completion | Press Tab to complete paths |
| Multi-line input | Shift+Enter, or Ctrl+Enter on Windows Terminal |
| Copy response | Ctrl+X copies the selected message in `/tree`; otherwise it copies the last assistant message, or the active fullscreen text selection when `fullscreenCopyOnSelect` is disabled |
| Edit response | Ctrl+E on an assistant message in `/tree` opens it in the editor; submitting continues the session from the edited copy |
| Images | Paste with Ctrl+V, Alt+V on Windows, or drag into the terminal |
| Shell command | `!command` runs and sends output to the model |
| Hidden shell command | `!!command` runs without sending output to the model |
| Manual continue | Type `.` alone to resume the most recent intent without sending a new user message |
| External editor | Ctrl+G opens `externalEditor`, `$VISUAL`, `$EDITOR`, Notepad on Windows, or `nano` elsewhere |
| Shortcut overlay | Type `?` on an empty editor to show a dismissible shortcut grid |
| Startup tips | A rotating `Tip:` line in the startup banner and under the working status teaches features; disable with `"tips": false` |

See [Keybindings](keybindings.md) for all shortcuts and customization.

## Slash Commands

Type `/` in the editor to open command completion. Extensions can register custom commands, skills are available as `/skill:name`, and prompt templates expand via `/templatename`.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/login`, `/logout` | Manage OAuth or API-key credentials |
| [`/llama`](llama-cpp.md) | Download, load, and unload llama.cpp router models |
| `/model` | Switch this session's model; Ctrl+S in the picker, or `/model <id> --default`, also makes it the startup default |
| `/thinking [level]` | Set the thinking level for this session (`/thinking high`), or open the picker with no argument; Ctrl+S in the picker saves it as the startup default |
| `/scoped-models` | Enable/disable models for Ctrl+P cycling |
| `/reasoning [on\|off]` | Show or toggle reasoning for the current model |
| `/efforts [level]` | Show or set reasoning effort (graded models only) |
| `/fast [on\|off]` | Toggle fast mode (ChatGPT Subscription models, persisted per model) |
| `/settings` | Theme, message delivery, transport, and other preferences |
| `/resume`, `/sessions` | Pick from previous sessions (`/sessions` is an alias) |
| `/new` | Start a new session |
| `/rename [name]` | Rename the current session (`/name` is an alias) |
| `/session` | Show session file, ID, messages, tokens, and cost |
| `/tree` | Jump to any point in the session and continue from there |
| `/trust` | Save project trust decision for future sessions |
| `/fork` | Create a new session from a previous user message |
| `/clone` | Duplicate the current active branch into a new session |
| `/compact [prompt]` | Manually compact context, optionally with custom instructions |
| `/copy` | Copy last assistant message to clipboard |
| `/export [file]` | Export session to HTML or JSONL |
| `/import <file>` | Import and resume a session from a JSONL file |
| `/share` | Upload as private GitHub gist with shareable HTML link |
| `/reload` | Reload keybindings, extensions, skills, prompts, themes, and context files |
| `/hotkeys` | Show all keyboard shortcuts |
| `/help` | Getting-started primer, live keybindings, and all commands in a scrollable overlay |
| `/keybindings` | Open your `keybindings.json` in `$EDITOR` (seeded with current bindings when missing) and reload it live |
| `/changelog` | Display version history |
| `/quit`, `/exit` | Quit senpi |

### Reasoning and Fast Mode Commands

**Changing the thinking level.** `/thinking <level>` sets it for this session and `/thinking` alone opens a picker. Shift+Tab cycles through the levels the model supports, and `/efforts <level>` sets the reasoning effort for graded models; both remember the level for the current model. The footer shows the active level after the model name.

**`/reasoning [on|off]`** shows or toggles reasoning. Behavior adapts to the active model:

- Models without reasoning support are told plainly.
- Always-on models reject `/reasoning off`.
- On/off-only and graded models toggle normally.

`/reasoning on` restores the effort level you last used for that model. No-arg shows current status.

**`/efforts [minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh|max]`** sets the reasoning effort ladder for graded models. On/off-only models are directed to use `/reasoning` instead. `xhigh` and `max` appear only when the model supports them. No-arg shows current effort and available levels.

**`/fast [on|off]`** toggles ChatGPT Subscription fast mode (`service_tier: "priority"`). The choice is remembered per model and survives restarts. No-arg toggles. Non-Codex models are told fast mode is unavailable. If the active model selection pins `:priority` via a favorite decorator, `/fast off` is blocked and explains why.

All three commands work over RPC and headless (no selector opened, status sent as text notifications).

## Message Queue

You can submit messages while the agent is still working:

- **Enter** queues a steering message, delivered after the current assistant turn finishes executing its tool calls.
- **Alt+Enter** queues a follow-up message, delivered after the agent finishes all work.
- **Escape** aborts and restores queued messages to the editor.
- **Alt+Up** retrieves queued messages back to the editor.

On Windows Terminal, Alt+Enter is fullscreen by default. Remap it as described in [Terminal setup](terminal-setup.md) if you want senpi to receive the shortcut.

Configure delivery in [Settings](settings.md) with `steeringMode` and `followUpMode`.

## Sessions

Sessions are saved automatically to `~/.senpi/agent/sessions/`, organized by working directory.

```bash
senpi -c                  # Continue most recent session
senpi -r                  # Browse and select a session
senpi --no-session        # Ephemeral mode; do not save
senpi --name "my task"    # Set session display name at startup
senpi --session <path|id> # Use a specific session file or session ID
senpi --fork <path|id>    # Fork a session into a new session file
```

Useful session commands:

- `/resume` (or its alias `/sessions`) opens the same picker as `senpi -r` without leaving the TUI.
- `/session` shows the current session file and ID.
- `/tree` navigates the in-file session tree and can summarize abandoned branches. Ctrl+E on an assistant entry edits that response in place of the original (the original stays in the file on an abandoned branch; tool calls in the edited response are dropped).
- `/fork` creates a new session from an earlier user message.
- `/clone` duplicates the current active branch into a new session file.
- `/compact` summarizes older messages to free context.

See [Sessions](sessions.md) and [Compaction](compaction.md) for details.
To see where a long session's memory goes, start senpi with `SENPI_MEMORY_REPORT=1` and send the process `SIGUSR2` from another terminal (`kill -USR2 <pid>`): it writes a per-layer report (main thread, eval kernels, resident session strings, tool-card render cache, extension figures) to `<session>-artifacts/memory/<iso>.json` and keeps running. Add `SENPI_MEMORY_REPORT_SNAPSHOT=1` for a heap snapshot beside it. Nothing is installed without the flag; see [RPC](rpc.md#memory_report) for the report fields.


## Context Files

Senpi loads `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` at startup from:

- `~/.senpi/agent/AGENTS.md` for global instructions
- parent directories, walking up from the current working directory
- the current directory

If a directory contains `AGENTS.override.md`, senpi loads it instead of `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` from that directory. Context files from other directories still layer normally.

Use context files for project conventions, commands, safety rules, and preferences. Disable loading with `--no-context-files` or `-nc`.

### System Prompt Files

Replace the default system prompt with:

- `.senpi/SYSTEM.md` for a project
- `~/.senpi/agent/SYSTEM.md` globally

Append to the default prompt without replacing it with `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` in either location.

### Project Trust

On interactive startup, senpi asks before trusting a project folder that contains project-local settings, resources, or project `.agents/skills` and has no saved decision for the folder or a parent folder in `~/.senpi/agent/trust.json`. Trusting a project allows senpi to load `.senpi/settings.json` and `.senpi` resources, install missing project packages, and execute project extensions.

Before the trust decision, senpi loads only context files, user/global extensions, and CLI `-e` extensions so they can handle the `project_trust` event. Project-local extensions, project package-managed extensions, and project settings are loaded only after the project is trusted. This split also applies when switching to a session from a different cwd whose trust has not been resolved in the current process.

Non-interactive modes (`-p`, `--mode json`, and `--mode rpc`) do not show a trust prompt. Without an applicable saved trust decision, they use `defaultProjectTrust` from global settings: `ask` (default) and `never` ignore those project resources, while `always` trusts them. Pass `--approve`/`-a` or `--no-approve`/`-na` to override project trust for one run.

If no extension or saved decision applies, `defaultProjectTrust` controls the fallback behavior. Set it to `"ask"`, `"always"`, or `"never"` in `~/.senpi/agent/settings.json`, or change it with `/settings`.

`senpi config` and package commands use the same project trust flow, except `senpi update` never prompts. Pass `--approve` to trust project-local settings for one command or `--no-approve` to ignore them.

Use `/trust` in interactive mode to save a project trust decision for future sessions, including trust for the immediate parent folder. It writes `~/.senpi/agent/trust.json` only; the current session is not reloaded, so restart senpi for changes to take effect.


## Exporting and Sharing Sessions

Use `/export [file]` to write a session to HTML.

Use `/share` to upload a private GitHub gist with a shareable HTML link.

If you use pi for open source work and want to publish sessions for model, prompt, tool, and evaluation research, see [`badlogic/pi-share-hf`](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-share-hf). It publishes sessions to Hugging Face datasets.

## CLI Reference

```bash
senpi [options] [--] [@files...] [messages...]
```

### Package Commands

```bash
senpi install <source> [-l]     # Install package, -l for project-local
senpi remove <source> [-l]      # Remove package
senpi uninstall <source> [-l]   # Alias for remove
senpi update [source|self|senpi]   # Update senpi only, or one package source
senpi update --all              # Update senpi and packages; reconcile pinned git refs
senpi update --extensions       # Update packages only; reconcile pinned git refs
senpi update --models           # Refresh model catalogs only
senpi update --self             # Update senpi only
senpi update --extension <src>  # Update one package
senpi list                      # List installed packages
senpi config                    # Enable/disable package resources
senpi config import-pi [file]   # Copy config edited in ~/.pi/agent into ~/.senpi/agent (backs up first)
```

After the first start copies an upstream pi install's `~/.pi/agent` into `~/.senpi/agent`, senpi reads only `~/.senpi/agent`. When `auth.json`, `keybindings.json`, `models.json` or `settings.json` in `~/.pi/agent` changes later, the next interactive start warns once per change; `senpi config import-pi` copies the edited files over, or only the ones you name, and never writes to `~/.pi/agent`.

These commands manage senpi packages and `senpi update` can update the senpi CLI installation. To uninstall senpi itself, see [Quickstart](quickstart.md#uninstall). `senpi config` and project package commands accept `--approve`/`--no-approve` to trust or ignore project-local settings for one command. `senpi update` never prompts for project trust.

See [Senpi Packages](packages.md) for package sources and security notes.

### Modes

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| default | Interactive mode |
| `-p`, `--print` | Print response and exit |
| `--mode json` | Output all events as JSON lines; see [JSON mode](json.md) |
| `--mode rpc` | RPC mode over stdin/stdout; see [RPC mode](rpc.md) |
| `--export <in> [out]` | Export a session to HTML |

In print mode, senpi also reads piped stdin and merges it into the initial prompt:

```bash
cat README.md | senpi -p "Summarize this text"
```

### Model Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--provider <name>` | Provider, such as `anthropic`, `openai`, or `google`; requires `--model` |
| `--model <pattern>` | Model pattern or ID; supports `provider/id` and optional `:<thinking>` |
| `--api-key <key>` | API key, overriding environment variables |
| `--thinking <level>` | `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` |
| `--models <patterns>` | Comma-separated patterns for Ctrl+P cycling |
| `--list-models [search]` | List available models |

### Session Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-c`, `--continue` | Continue the most recent session |
| `-r`, `--resume` | Browse and select a session |
| `--session <path\|id>` | Use a specific session file or partial UUID |
| `--fork <path\|id>` | Fork a session file or partial UUID into a new session |
| `--rebind <path\|id>` | Move a session of this repository, recorded at another path (moved or re-cloned), into this directory and continue it |
| `--session-dir <dir>` | Custom session storage directory |
| `--no-session` | Ephemeral mode; do not save |
| `--name <name>`, `-n <name>` | Set session display name at startup |

### Tool Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--tools <list>`, `-t <list>` | Allowlist specific built-in, extension, and custom tools |
| `--exclude-tools <list>`, `-xt <list>` | Disable specific built-in, extension, and custom tools |
| `--no-builtin-tools`, `-nbt` | Disable built-in tools but keep extension/custom tools enabled |
| `--no-tools`, `-nt` | Disable all tools |

Built-in tools: `read`, `bash`, `edit`, `write`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`.

#### `grep` tool contract

Use `tool.grep({ pattern, path, glob, ignoreCase, literal, context, before, after, mode, limit, skip, timeoutMs, hidden, gitignore })` inside eval. `pattern` is required; `path` accepts a file, directory, array, or a `<file>:L1-L2` selector. `glob` accepts positive patterns and `!` exclusions. `mode` is `content` (default), `count`, or `files`; `limit` and `skip` paginate file results. `before`/`after` override `context`.

Content output uses `path` blocks with `N: match` and `N- context` rows, followed by a footer such as `[grep: matches=2 files=2 searched=42 elapsedMs=8 engine=native nextSkip=none]`. The footer is always present. Tool results include `details` v1 with structured matches, file counts, scan status, and pagination metadata.

The engine is selected automatically. `SENPI_GREP_ENGINE=auto|native|rg` selects the preferred engine, and `SENPI_GREP_NATIVE_PATH` overrides the native addon path. Native search honors filesystem policy and ignore files; ripgrep is the fallback.

### Resource Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-e`, `--extension <source>` | Load an extension from path, npm, or git; repeatable |
| `--no-extensions` | Disable extension discovery |
| `--skill <path>` | Load a skill; repeatable |
| `--no-skills` | Disable skill discovery |
| `--prompt-template <path>` | Load a prompt template; repeatable |
| `--no-prompt-templates` | Disable prompt template discovery |
| `--theme <path>` | Load a theme; repeatable |
| `--no-themes` | Disable theme discovery |
| `--no-context-files`, `-nc` | Disable `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` discovery |

Combine `--no-*` with explicit flags to load exactly what you need, ignoring settings. Example:

```bash
senpi --no-extensions -e ./my-extension.ts
```

### Other Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--system-prompt <text>` | Replace the generated base prompt (text or a file path); per-model prompt presets step aside; context files and skills are still appended |
| `--append-system-prompt <text>` | Append to the system prompt (repeatable; text or a file path); applies after per-model prompt presets |
| `--tui-mode <mode>` | TUI mode: `regular` (default) or experimental `fullscreen` |
| `--use-theme <name[/name]>` | Set the initial interactive theme for this run without changing settings |
| `--verbose` | Force verbose startup |
| `-a`, `--approve` | Trust project-local files for this run |
| `-na`, `--no-approve` | Ignore project-local files for this run |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show help |
| `-v`, `--version` | Show version |

In `fullscreen` mode, the transcript scrolls inside the terminal viewport while queued messages, working status, extension widgets, editor, and footer remain fixed at the bottom. Mouse/trackpad input scrolls the region under the pointer; keyboard viewport actions always remain available. Inline images work in terminals that support the Kitty graphics protocol, including Kitty and Ghostty. In iTerm2 they render as text placeholders because its inline-image protocol cannot delete or crop placements during application-owned scrolling. In `regular` mode, senpi uses the main screen and terminal-owned scrollback, and iTerm2 inline images continue to render normally. See [Terminal setup](terminal-setup.md) for terminal-specific settings and workarounds.

Set **TUI mode** in `/settings` to switch between `regular` and `fullscreen` immediately and choose the default for future sessions. **Fullscreen exit output** controls whether exiting fullscreen prints the final transcript or restores the previous screen and prints only the session resume hint.

### File Arguments

Prefix files with `@` to include them in the message:

```bash
senpi @prompt.md "Answer this"
senpi -p @screenshot.png "What's in this image?"
senpi @code.ts @test.ts "Review these files"
```

### Examples

```bash
# Interactive with initial prompt
senpi "List all .ts files in src/"

# Non-interactive
senpi -p "Summarize this codebase"

# Prompt beginning with a dash
senpi -p -- "- Summarize these points"

# Non-interactive with piped stdin
cat README.md | senpi -p "Summarize this text"

# Named one-shot session
senpi --name "release audit" -p "Audit this repository"

# Different model
senpi --provider openai --model gpt-4o "Help me refactor"

# Model with provider prefix
senpi --model openai/gpt-4o "Help me refactor"

# Model with thinking level shorthand
senpi --model sonnet:high "Solve this complex problem"

# Limit model cycling
senpi --models "claude-*,gpt-4o"

# Read-only mode
senpi --tools read,grep,find,ls -p "Review the code"

# Disable one extension or built-in tool while keeping the rest available
senpi --exclude-tools ask_question
```

## Design Principles

Senpi keeps the core small and pushes workflow-specific behavior into extensions, skills, prompt templates, and packages.

It intentionally does not include built-in MCP, sub-agents, plan mode, to-dos, background bash, or an in-process sandbox. Use permission presets for tool-call confirmation policy, and use external tools such as containers, VMs, policy sandboxes, and tmux when you need stronger workflow or isolation behavior.

For the full rationale, read the [blog post](https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-30-pi-coding-agent/).
