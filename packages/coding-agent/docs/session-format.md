# Session File Format

Sessions are stored as JSONL (JSON Lines) files. Each line is a JSON object with a `type` field. Session entries form a tree structure via `id`/`parentId` fields, enabling in-place branching without creating new files.

This document describes the CLI session files written by `SessionManager` in `packages/coding-agent`. The agent harness in `packages/agent` keeps its own durable session data (header version 4, with compaction checkpoints that embed retained context) and the CBOR `pi-protocol` server/client stack speaks protocol v8. Those formats are separate from the CLI JSONL described here and are not interchangeable with it.

## File Location

```
~/.senpi/agent/sessions/--<path>--/<timestamp>_<session-id>.jsonl
```

By default, `<session-id>` is a UUID. Callers can supply a custom ID through the SDK or `--session-id`. For `<path>`, Senpi removes the leading path separator and replaces `/`, `\\`, and `:` with `-`.

## Deleting Sessions

Sessions can be removed by deleting their `.jsonl` files under `~/.senpi/agent/sessions/`.

Senpi also supports deleting sessions interactively from `/resume` (select a session and press `Ctrl+D`, then confirm). When available, senpi uses the `trash` CLI to avoid permanent deletion.

## Session Version

Sessions have a version field in the header:

- **Version 1**: Linear entry sequence (legacy, auto-migrated on load)
- **Version 2**: Tree structure with `id`/`parentId` linking
- **Version 3**: Renamed `hookMessage` role to `custom` (extensions unification)

Existing sessions are automatically migrated to the current version (v3) when loaded.

## Message Types

Session entries contain `AgentMessage` objects. Understanding these types is essential for parsing sessions and writing extensions.

### Content Blocks

Messages contain arrays of typed content blocks:

```typescript
interface TextContent {
  type: "text";
  text: string;
  textSignature?: string;
}

interface ImageContent {
  type: "image";
  data: string;      // base64 encoded
  mimeType: string;  // e.g., "image/jpeg", "image/png"
}

interface ThinkingContent {
  type: "thinking";
  thinking: string;
  startedAt?: number;  // Unix epoch milliseconds
  endedAt?: number;    // Unix epoch milliseconds
  thinkingSignature?: string;
  redacted?: boolean;
}

`startedAt` and `endedAt` are optional epoch milliseconds stamped by the agent loop at stream-event receipt on a best-effort basis. They are absent on pre-feature sessions and on messages not produced through the agent loop. Renderers must treat their absence as "no timing available".

interface ToolCall {
  type: "toolCall";
  id: string;
  name: string;
  arguments: Record<string, any>;
  thoughtSignature?: string;
  namespace?: string;
}
```

### Base Message Types (from pi-ai)

```typescript
interface UserMessage {
  role: "user";
  content: string | (TextContent | ImageContent)[];
  timestamp: number;  // Unix ms
}

interface AssistantMessage {
  role: "assistant";
  content: (TextContent | ThinkingContent | ToolCall)[];
  api: string;
  provider: string;
  model: string;
  responseModel?: string;
  responseId?: string;
  providerThinkingLevel?: string;
  diagnostics?: AssistantMessageDiagnostic[];
  usage: Usage;
  stopReason: "pending" | "stop" | "length" | "toolUse" | "error" | "aborted" | "deferred";
  deferred?: DeferredHandle;
  errorMessage?: string;
  rawStopReason?: string;
  endTurn?: boolean;
  timestamp: number;
}

interface ToolResultMessage {
  role: "toolResult";
  toolCallId: string;
  toolName: string;
  content: (TextContent | ImageContent)[];
  details?: any;      // Tool-specific metadata
  usage?: Usage;      // Nested LLM work performed by the tool
  addedToolNames?: string[];
  isError: boolean;
  timestamp: number;
}

interface Usage {
  input: number;
  output: number;
  cacheRead: number;
  cacheWrite: number;
  cacheWrite1h?: number;
  reasoning?: number;
  totalTokens: number;
  cost: {
    input: number;
    output: number;
    cacheRead: number;
    cacheWrite: number;
    total: number;
  };
}
```

`"pending"` is reserved for partial messages in streaming events. Terminal events replace it with a completion reason before Senpi persists the assistant message, so `"pending"` should never appear in session JSONL. `"deferred"` is a terminal reason for a provider response that will complete later; its `deferred` handle contains the provider data needed to retrieve that response.

### Extended Message Types (from @code-yeongyu/senpi)

```typescript
interface BashExecutionMessage {
  role: "bashExecution";
  command: string;
  output: string;
  exitCode: number | undefined;
  cancelled: boolean;
  truncated: boolean;
  fullOutputPath?: string;
  excludeFromContext?: boolean;  // true for !! prefix commands
  timestamp: number;
}

interface CustomMessage {
  role: "custom";
  customType: string;            // Extension identifier
  content: string | (TextContent | ImageContent)[];
  display: boolean;              // Show in TUI
  details?: any;                 // Extension-specific metadata
  timestamp: number;
}

interface BranchSummaryMessage {
  role: "branchSummary";
  summary: string;
  fromId: string | null;         // Previous leaf whose abandoned path was summarized
  timestamp: number;
}

interface CompactionSummaryMessage {
  role: "compactionSummary";
  summary: string;
  tokensBefore: number;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

### AgentMessage Union

```typescript
type AgentMessage =
  | UserMessage
  | AssistantMessage
  | ToolResultMessage
  | BashExecutionMessage
  | CustomMessage
  | BranchSummaryMessage
  | CompactionSummaryMessage;
```

## Entry Base

All entries (except `SessionHeader`) extend `SessionEntryBase`:

```typescript
interface SessionEntryBase {
  type: string;
  id: string;           // Usually an 8-char hex ID; may fall back to a full UUID
  parentId: string | null;  // Parent entry ID (null for a root entry)
  timestamp: string;    // ISO timestamp
}
```

## Entry Types

### SessionHeader

First line of the file. Metadata only, not part of the tree (no `id`/`parentId`).

```json
{"type":"session","version":3,"id":"uuid","timestamp":"2024-12-03T14:00:00.000Z","cwd":"/path/to/project"}
```

For sessions with a parent (created via `/fork`, `/clone`, or `newSession({ parentSession })`):

```json
{"type":"session","version":3,"id":"uuid","timestamp":"2024-12-03T14:00:00.000Z","cwd":"/path/to/project","parentSession":"/path/to/original/session.jsonl"}
```

### SessionMessageEntry

A message in the conversation. The `message` field contains an `AgentMessage`.

```json
{"type":"message","id":"a1b2c3d4","parentId":"prev1234","timestamp":"2024-12-03T14:00:01.000Z","message":{"role":"user","content":"Hello","timestamp":1733234401000}}
{"type":"message","id":"b2c3d4e5","parentId":"a1b2c3d4","timestamp":"2024-12-03T14:00:02.000Z","message":{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Hi!"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-sonnet-4-5","usage":{...},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1733234402000}}
{"type":"message","id":"c3d4e5f6","parentId":"b2c3d4e5","timestamp":"2024-12-03T14:00:03.000Z","message":{"role":"toolResult","toolCallId":"call_123","toolName":"bash","content":[{"type":"text","text":"output"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1733234403000}}
```

### ModelChangeEntry

Emitted when the user switches models mid-session. The latest entry is the selected model, which may be a [virtual model](virtual-models.md); assistant messages then name the physical model that answered.

```json
{"type":"model_change","id":"d4e5f6g7","parentId":"c3d4e5f6","timestamp":"2024-12-03T14:05:00.000Z","provider":"openai","modelId":"gpt-4o","originalProvider":"anthropic","originalModelId":"claude-sonnet-4-5","source":"picker","actor":"model-selector"}
```

`source` says what made the switch: `command` (a typed `/model`), `picker` (the model or favorites picker), `cycle` (the favorites cycle key), `control` (a terminal's control endpoint), `rpc` (RPC `set_model`, `cycle_model` and `set_fast_mode`; `actor` names the latter two), `app-server`, `extension` (`actor` is the extension path), `provider-login`, `fallback`, `fallback-revert`, `held-switch` (a switch held until compaction made room; `actor` names what first asked for it), `restore`, or `sdk` (an SDK caller that named none). `actor` says who issued it where that is known. `duringTurn: true` marks a switch that landed while a turn was streaming; the terminal shows those as a transcript row. Entries written before these fields existed omit them. A `thinking_level_change` written because a switch re-applied the model's level carries the same `triggerSource` and `triggerActor`.

### ThinkingLevelChangeEntry

Emitted when the user changes the thinking/reasoning level.

```json
{"type":"thinking_level_change","id":"e5f6g7h8","parentId":"d4e5f6g7","timestamp":"2024-12-03T14:06:00.000Z","thinkingLevel":"high"}
```

### CompactionEntry

Created when context is compacted. Stores a summary of earlier messages.

```json
{"type":"compaction","id":"f6g7h8i9","parentId":"e5f6g7h8","timestamp":"2024-12-03T14:10:00.000Z","summary":"User discussed X, Y, Z...","firstKeptEntryId":"c3d4e5f6","tokensBefore":50000}
```

`firstKeptEntryId` is required. It identifies the first entry retained from before the compaction entry. When rebuilding context, Pi replaces older summarized entries with the compaction summary and keeps the range beginning at this entry. A retain-none compaction (`appendCompaction(summary, null, tokensBefore)`) stores its own ID in this field, so no preceding entries are retained.

Optional fields:
- `usage`: LLM usage from generating the summary; included in session token and cost totals
- `details`: Implementation-specific data (e.g., `{ readFiles: string[], modifiedFiles: string[] }` for default, or custom data for extensions)
- `fromHook`: `true` if generated by an extension, `false`/`undefined` if senpi-generated (legacy field name)

### ContextEditEntry

Append-only edit of one earlier context-producing entry. It changes only future model context; the target entry and its metadata stay unchanged in raw history, UI, exports, and session accounting.

```json
{"type":"context_edit","id":"g6h7i8j9","parentId":"f6g7h8i9","timestamp":"2024-12-03T14:11:00.000Z","targetId":"c3d4e5f6","replacement":null}
```

Targets may be user, assistant, tool-result, or custom-message entries. `replacement: null` omits the target from model context. A non-null `replacement` replaces only the target message content; string replacements for assistant and tool-result entries are normalized to one text block. If several edits target the same entry, the latest edit on the active branch wins. Edits are branch-relative: navigating to a point before the edit reveals the target's original contribution again. `ContextEditEntry` is part of the exported `SessionEntry` union, so exhaustive entry switches must handle `context_edit`.

### BranchSummaryEntry

Created when switching branches via `/tree` with an LLM generated summary of the left branch up to the common ancestor. Captures context from the abandoned path.

```json
{"type":"branch_summary","id":"g7h8i9j0","parentId":"a1b2c3d4","timestamp":"2024-12-03T14:15:00.000Z","fromId":"f6g7h8i9","summary":"Branch explored approach A..."}
```

`parentId` is the entry from which the new branch continues. `fromId` is the previous leaf whose abandoned path was summarized.

Optional fields:
- `usage`: LLM usage from generating the summary; included in session token and cost totals
- `details`: File tracking data (`{ readFiles: string[], modifiedFiles: string[] }`) for default, or custom data for extensions
- `fromHook`: `true` if generated by an extension, `false`/`undefined` if senpi-generated (legacy field name)

### CustomEntry

Extension state persistence. Does NOT participate in LLM context.

```json
{"type":"custom","id":"h8i9j0k1","parentId":"g7h8i9j0","timestamp":"2024-12-03T14:20:00.000Z","customType":"my-extension","data":{"count":42}}
```

Use `customType` to identify your extension's entries on reload. Interactive mode can render custom entries via `pi.registerEntryRenderer(customType, renderer)`, but they still do not participate in LLM context.

[Virtual model](virtual-models.md) router state is stored as custom entries with `customType` `pi.virtual-model-state` and `data` `{ provider, modelId, state }`.

#### Goal and engine self-stop entries

These custom entries are persisted in the session and delivered to RPC clients as `entry_appended`. They do not enter model context. Existing `engine-turn-limit`, `ttsr-loop-stopped`, and notices remain unchanged.

- `goal-continuation-stopped`: `data` is `{ goalId: string, reason: "stale" | "repetition" | "cap" | "unattended" | "length-exhausted" | "context-overflow", consecutiveContinuations: number, unattendedContinuations: number, at: number }`. Every active-goal denial except `not-eligible` and `single-flight` records one decision, not one entry per evaluation probe. Blocking guards still block; stale leaves the goal active but commits the remaining measured time and closes its measurement window. An accepted user message or `/goal resume` resets the stop and continuation streak and opens accounting again. The stop entry remains historical; a subsequent continuation can stop again.
- `engine-paused`: `data` is `{ reason: "repetition" | "goal-repeat" | "cap-per-message" | "cap-per-minute" | "goal-stale", rule?: string, customType?: string, count?: number, at: number }`. The engine limit maps `per-user-input` to `cap-per-message` (`count` is `sinceUserInput`) and `tool-free-rate` to `cap-per-minute` (`count` is `toolFreeInWindow`). TTSR uses `repetition` and names the rule when it refuses another correction or its one-shot repetitive-turns correction reaches final idle without another turn starting. Goal output repetition uses `goal-repeat`; stale uses `goal-stale`, with the consecutive-continuation count and `customType: "goal-continuation"`.

`at` is Unix epoch milliseconds. Consumers can use these entries instead of parsing notice wording, and replay them from session history after reopen.

Stale-stopped goals stay stopped when reopened. A notice at the stale stop and on each session open tells the user to send a message or run `/goal resume` to continue; rendering and extension reloads do not repeat the notice.

Goal usage measures work while the goal's accounting window is open. Non-user-input turns, including extension `sendUserMessage` and `sendMessage({ triggerTurn: true })` deliveries, add neither tokens nor time to a stale-stopped goal, just as later turns do not accrue usage for a user-paused or completed goal. The same turns count assistant input/output tokens and elapsed time while the goal is active with an open window. Usage is display-only; it does not impose a budget limit.

The footer shows `Goal stopped: no progress (send a message or /goal resume)` without a pursuit timer, and `/goal` identifies the stop while retaining committed usage totals. The persisted goal keeps `status: "active"` plus `continuationStoppedAt` so accepted input and `/goal resume` retain their existing behavior. Goal-tool snapshots instead report `status: "paused"` and include `continuationStoppedAt` for the stopped label; their cards use the paused glyph and styling. App-server `ThreadGoal.status` also reports `paused`, using its existing schema. Active, user-paused, blocked, and completed goals otherwise retain their displays.

In the persisted goal state, `lastStartedAt` is the last usage checkpoint, in Unix epoch seconds, not the start of the entire run. Clients displaying live elapsed time use committed `timeUsedSeconds` plus the nonnegative time since `lastStartedAt`. When `lastStartedAt` is absent, including after a stale stop, display only committed `timeUsedSeconds`.

Model-facing goal tool JSON additionally includes `continuation: { status: "stale_stopped", message: string }` for a stale-stopped goal. The message explains that progress was stale and the goal resumes when the user sends a message or runs `/goal resume`. This object is absent for ordinary active, user-paused, and completed goals; it is not part of the stored goal, UI snapshot, or app-server schema.

### CustomMessageEntry

Extension-injected messages that DO participate in LLM context.

```json
{"type":"custom_message","id":"i9j0k1l2","parentId":"h8i9j0k1","timestamp":"2024-12-03T14:25:00.000Z","customType":"my-extension","content":"Injected context...","display":true}
```

Fields:
- `content`: String or `(TextContent | ImageContent)[]` (same as UserMessage)
- `display`: `true` = show in TUI with distinct styling, `false` = hidden
- `details`: Optional extension-specific metadata (not sent to LLM)

### LabelEntry

User-defined bookmark/marker on an entry.

```json
{"type":"label","id":"j0k1l2m3","parentId":"i9j0k1l2","timestamp":"2024-12-03T14:30:00.000Z","targetId":"a1b2c3d4","label":"checkpoint-1"}
```

Set `label` to `undefined` to clear a label.

### SessionInfoEntry

Session metadata (e.g., user-defined display name). Set via `/rename` or `/name`, `--name` / `-n`, or `pi.setSessionName()` in extensions.

```json
{"type":"session_info","id":"k1l2m3n4","parentId":"j0k1l2m3","timestamp":"2024-12-03T14:35:00.000Z","name":"Refactor auth module"}
```

The session name is displayed in the session selector (`/resume`) instead of the first message when set.

## Tree Structure

Entries normally form one tree, but navigation APIs can create multiple roots:
- A root entry has `parentId: null`; the first entry is initially the root
- Each non-root entry points to its parent via `parentId`
- Branching creates new children from an earlier entry
- The "leaf" is the current position in the tree
- Calling `resetLeaf()` or `branchWithSummary(null, ...)` allows a later entry to become another root

```
[user msg] ─── [assistant] ─── [user msg] ─── [assistant] ─┬─ [user msg] ← current leaf
                                                            │
                                                            └─ [branch_summary] ─── [user msg] ← alternate branch
```

## Context Building

`buildContextEntries()` walks from the current leaf to the root, producing the active entry list while honoring compaction:

1. Collects all entries on the path
2. If one or more `CompactionEntry` values are on the path, uses the latest one:
   - Includes the compaction entry first
   - Includes entries from `firstKeptEntryId` up to, but not including, the compaction entry
   - Includes entries after the compaction entry
3. Preserves non-message entries in the selected range so interactive mode can render them

`buildSessionContext()` builds on that entry list to produce the message list for the LLM:

1. Extracts current model and thinking level settings from the full path
2. Converts selected entries to messages:
   - `message` -> stored `AgentMessage`
   - `compaction` -> `compactionSummary`
   - `branch_summary` -> `branchSummary`
   - `custom_message` -> `CustomMessage`
   - `custom` -> no context message
   - `context_edit` -> no context message of its own; the latest edit for each target omits or replaces that target's message

The compaction summary replaces entries before `firstKeptEntryId`. The retained entries and all entries after the compaction remain available to the LLM.

## Parsing Example

```typescript
import { readFileSync } from "fs";

const lines = readFileSync("session.jsonl", "utf8").trim().split("\n");

for (const line of lines) {
  const entry = JSON.parse(line);

  switch (entry.type) {
    case "session":
      console.log(`Session v${entry.version ?? 1}: ${entry.id}`);
      break;
    case "message":
      console.log(`[${entry.id}] ${entry.message.role}: ${JSON.stringify(entry.message.content)}`);
      break;
    case "compaction":
      console.log(`[${entry.id}] Compaction: ${entry.tokensBefore} tokens summarized`);
      break;
    case "branch_summary":
      console.log(`[${entry.id}] Branch from ${entry.fromId}`);
      break;
    case "custom":
      console.log(`[${entry.id}] Custom (${entry.customType}): ${JSON.stringify(entry.data)}`);
      break;
    case "custom_message":
      console.log(`[${entry.id}] Extension message (${entry.customType}): ${entry.content}`);
      break;
    case "label":
      console.log(`[${entry.id}] Label "${entry.label}" on ${entry.targetId}`);
      break;
    case "model_change":
      console.log(`[${entry.id}] Model: ${entry.provider}/${entry.modelId}`);
      break;
    case "thinking_level_change":
      console.log(`[${entry.id}] Thinking: ${entry.thinkingLevel}`);
      break;
  }
}
```

## SessionManager API

Key methods for working with sessions programmatically.

### Static Creation Methods
- `SessionManager.create(cwd, sessionDir?, options?)` - New session; `options` can set `id` and `parentSession`
- `SessionManager.open(path, sessionDir?, cwdOverride?)` - Open existing session file
- `SessionManager.continueRecent(cwd, sessionDir?)` - Continue most recent or create new
- `SessionManager.inMemory(cwd?, options?, entries?)` - No file persistence, optionally initialized from entries
- `SessionManager.forkFrom(sourcePath, targetCwd, sessionDir?, options?)` - Fork session from another project

### Static Listing Methods
- `SessionManager.list(cwd, sessionDir?, onProgress?)` - List sessions for a directory
- `SessionManager.listAll(onProgress?)` - List all sessions across all projects
- `SessionManager.listAll(sessionDir?, onProgress?)` - List sessions from a custom session root

### Instance Methods - Session Management
- `newSession(options?)` - Start a new session (options: `{ id?: string, parentSession?: string }`)
- `setSessionFile(path)` - Switch to a different session file
- `createBranchedSession(leafId)` - Extract branch to new session file

### Instance Methods - Appending (all return entry ID)
- `appendMessage(message)` - Add message (the session history keeps its own JSON copy)
- `appendOwnedMessage(message)` - Add a message the session's own agent produced: the history keeps a shallow copy sharing the message's content (falls back to the JSON copy for a message with a resident string or a non-JSON value)
- `appendThinkingLevelChange(level)` - Record thinking change
- `appendModelChange(provider, modelId)` - Record model change
- `appendCompaction(summary, firstKeptEntryId, tokensBefore, details?, fromHook?, usage?)` - Add compaction; pass `null` as `firstKeptEntryId` to retain no earlier entries
- `appendContextEdit(targetId, replacement)` - Omit (`null`) or replace one entry's message in future model context without changing raw history
- `appendCustomEntry(customType, data?)` - Extension state (not in context)
- `appendSessionInfo(name)` - Set session display name
- `appendCustomMessageEntry(customType, content, display, details?)` - Extension message (in context)
- `appendLabelChange(targetId, label)` - Set/clear label

### Instance Methods - Tree Navigation
- `getLeafId()` - Current position
- `getLeafEntry()` - Get current leaf entry
- `getEntry(id)` - Get entry by ID
- `getBranch(fromId?)` - Walk from entry to root
- `getTree()` - Get full tree structure
- `getChildren(parentId)` - Get direct children
- `getLabel(id)` - Get label for entry
- `branch(entryId)` - Move leaf to earlier entry
- `resetLeaf()` - Reset leaf to null (before any entries)
- `branchWithSummary(entryId, summary, details?, fromHook?, usage?)` - Branch with context summary; `entryId` may be `null` to branch from the root

### Instance Methods - Context & Info
- `buildContextEntries()` - Get active branch entries with compaction applied
- `buildSessionContext()` - Get messages, thinkingLevel, and model for LLM
- `getEntries()` - All entries (excluding header)
- `getHeader()` - Session header metadata
- `getSessionName()` - Get display name from latest session_info entry
- `getCwd()` - Working directory
- `getSessionDir()` - Session storage directory
- `getSessionId()` - Session UUID
- `getSessionFile()` - Session file path (undefined for in-memory)
- `isPersisted()` - Whether session is saved to disk
