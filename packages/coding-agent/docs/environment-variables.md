# Environment Variables

Pi uses environment variables in three ways:

- Variables such as `PI_OFFLINE` configure the Pi process.
- Pi sets process markers so child processes can identify Pi as the launching agent.
- Commands run by the LLM-callable shell tools receive `PI_*` variables describing the current session.

Provider API-key variables are documented separately in [Providers](providers.md#environment-variables-or-auth-file).

## Process Marker

The CLI and RPC entry points set two process markers:

- `AI_AGENT=pi` is a generic marker that lets tooling identify Pi as the agent that launched the process.
- `PI_CODING_AGENT=true` is Pi-specific and lets child processes detect that they run inside Pi.

Child processes inherit both markers. They are not session-specific and are not set automatically when Pi is embedded through the SDK.

## Shell Tool Session Environment

Commands run by the `bash` and `powershell` tools receive the current Pi session state:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PI_SESSION_ID` | Current session ID |
| `PI_SESSION_FILE` | Absolute path to the current session JSONL file; unset for ephemeral sessions |
| `PI_SESSION_CWD` | Current session working directory, independent of the shell child's working directory |
| `PI_GOAL_STORE_FILE` | Absolute path to the session's authoritative goal-store file; the file need not exist yet |
| `PI_PROVIDER` | Currently selected model provider |
| `PI_MODEL` | Currently selected model ID |
| `PI_REASONING_LEVEL` | Current effective reasoning level: `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max` |
| `OMO_BROWSER_ENGINE` | Browser the opener chose for this session: `connected` (the user's own browser), `builtin` (the app's in-app browser) or `none`. Set only for a session opened with `open_session.browserEngine`; a session that chose none never sees the variable, even if the host process has one |

The values are resolved when each command starts. Switching models or changing the reasoning level therefore affects the next shell command without restarting Pi. `PI_PROVIDER` and `PI_MODEL` identify the selected Pi model, not a different upstream model that a router may choose internally.

When asked which model or provider is running, inspect these variables instead of inferring the answer from the system prompt:

```bash
printf '%s/%s\n' "$PI_PROVIDER" "$PI_MODEL"
printf 'reasoning=%s session=%s\n' "$PI_REASONING_LEVEL" "$PI_SESSION_ID"
```

The session file can be inspected directly when the session is persistent:

```bash
if [ -n "$PI_SESSION_FILE" ]; then
  tail -n 1 "$PI_SESSION_FILE"
fi
```

These variables are injected into the LLM-callable `bash` (including terminal-extension PTY sessions) and `powershell` tools. They are not injected into user-entered `!` or `!!` commands. Eval kernels receive the same session environment at kernel start, and their children inherit it. Inherited values for `PI_SESSION_CWD` and `PI_GOAL_STORE_FILE` are cleared before session values are applied; an unavailable optional goal-store path stays unset.

`PI_GOAL_STORE_FILE` comes from `ExtensionContext.goalStoreFile`, not from the session JSONL filename. Persisted sessions use the session manager's directory, including an explicit `SessionManager.open(path, otherSessionDir)` override. In-memory sessions use a cwd-hashed `extensions/goal/no-session/<hash>` bucket under the agent state directory. Reading the path does not create a goal or its file.

### Custom Shell Tools

Tools created with `createBashTool()` or `createPowerShellTool()` expose the session environment by default when registered with Pi. Injection happens before `spawnHook`, so a hook receives the variables in `ctx.env`:

```typescript
const bashTool = createBashTool(cwd, {
  spawnHook: (ctx) => ({
    ...ctx,
    env: { ...ctx.env, CI: "1" },
  }),
});
```

Disable session metadata independently of the spawn hook:

```typescript
const powershellTool = createPowerShellTool(cwd, {
  exposeSessionEnvironment: false,
  spawnHook: (ctx) => ctx,
});
```

When disabled, Pi removes inherited values for these variables so nested Pi processes do not expose stale parent-session metadata.

## Pi Process Configuration

These variables are read by Pi itself:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` | Override the config directory; default is `~/.pi/agent` |
| `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` | Override session storage; overridden by `--session-dir` |
| `PI_PACKAGE_DIR` | Override the package directory, useful for Nix/Guix store paths |
| `PI_OFFLINE` | Disable startup network operations, including update checks, package updates, and install/update telemetry |
| `PI_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK` | Disable the `pi.dev` latest-version request |
| `SENPI_RUNTIME` | `node` keeps senpi on Node.js and hides the Node.js runtime notice; `bun` re-execs under any installed Bun. Without it, a Bun-global install runs on its Bun and any other installed package runs on a discovered Bun 1.4.0 or newer |
| `PI_SKIP_RUNTIME_NOTICE` | Hide the one-time "Running on Node.js" notice without changing the runtime |
| `PI_TELEMETRY` | Override install/update telemetry and provider attribution headers: `1`/`true`/`yes` or `0`/`false`/`no` |
| `PI_CACHE_RETENTION` | Set to `long` to opt into extended provider prompt caching where supported; direct Anthropic defaults to 5 minutes |
| `PI_CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION` | Exact `X.Y.Z` to advertise as the Claude Code version on Anthropic OAuth requests (`claude-cli/<version>`) and skip the background lookup. Unset, senpi advertises the higher of its bundled floor and the latest published Claude Code, refreshed at most every six hours and cached in `<agent dir>/claude-code-version.json`; a `claude_code_version_too_old` rejection raises it and retries once |
| `PI_SHARE_VIEWER_URL` | Override the base URL used by `/share` |
| `PI_HARDWARE_CURSOR` | Set to `1` to show the hardware cursor; see [Terminal setup](terminal-setup.md) |
| `PI_HYPERLINKS` | Override OSC 8 hyperlink detection with `1`, `0`, or `auto` |
| `PI_IMAGE_PROTOCOL` | Override inline image detection with `kitty`, `iterm2`, `none`, or `auto` |
| `PI_TRUE_COLOR` | Override truecolor detection with `1`, `0`, or `auto` |

`SENPI_HYPERLINKS`, `SENPI_IMAGE_PROTOCOL`, and `SENPI_TRUE_COLOR` are equivalent capability overrides for branded Senpi distributions. They take precedence over the legacy `PI_*` names when both are set; explicit settings in the terminal configuration take precedence over either environment variable. The image protocol accepts `kitty`, `iterm2`, `none`, or `auto`.
| `PI_TUI_ESC_TIMEOUT` | How long to wait after a lone ESC before treating it as Escape, in milliseconds; defaults to `100` over SSH and `10` otherwise. Increase if Alt-key input is misread as Escape |
| `PI_TUI_BURST_WINDOW_MS` | When the terminal sends no bracketed-paste markers, how long a line break that ends a read with text is held in case the rest of a paste follows, in milliseconds; defaults to `100` over SSH and `20` otherwise. `0` never holds a line break. Increase if a slow connection still splits a paste into separate prompts |
| `SENPI_RECOVER_INSPECTOR_VM_IMPORT` | Set to `1` at process start to keep the TUI running when a Node Inspector (`node inspect` / `--inspect`) eval uses dynamic `import()`, which Node rejects with `ERR_VM_DYNAMIC_IMPORT_CALLBACK_MISSING`. Recovery applies only to that exact Inspector-originated rejection while an Inspector endpoint is active; all other uncaught errors remain fatal. Use `require()` or a target-side loader in Inspector evals instead |
| `SENPI_MEMORY_REPORT` | Set to `1` to install the on-demand memory report: the RPC `memory_report` request writes a per-layer report to `<session>-artifacts/memory/`, and `SIGUSR2` (POSIX) writes one for every session registered in the signalled process (all sessions of an in-process host; a worker-runtime host's sessions answer only over RPC); see [RPC](rpc.md#memory_report). Unset, nothing is installed |
| `SENPI_MEMORY_REPORT_SNAPSHOT` | With `SENPI_MEMORY_REPORT=1`, also write a heap snapshot of the main thread beside each report. A snapshot is a large allocation; use it only for diagnosis |
| `VISUAL`, `EDITOR` | External editor fallback when `externalEditor` is unset |
| `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` | Proxy outbound HTTP requests |

### Image Generation

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PI_OPENAI_IMAGE_GEN` | Enable or disable native `image_generation` server-tool injection on OpenAI Responses models. Accepts `1`/`true`/`yes` (default) or `0`/`false`/`no`. When disabled, the client-side `generate_image` tool is used instead |
| `PI_IMAGE_GEN_PROVIDER` | Pin a specific configured gateway provider for image generation (for example `quotio-openai`). The provider must have a resolvable API key and base URL in `models.json`. When unset, the credential resolver picks the best available source automatically |

Provider credentials such as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and cloud-provider configuration are listed in [Providers](providers.md#environment-variables-or-auth-file).

`PI_SERVER_DIR` and `PI_SERVER_ID` apply only to the source-only [experimental remote harness](development.md#experimental-remote-harness), not distributed builds.
