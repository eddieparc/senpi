# Skills

Skills are self-contained capability packages that the agent loads on-demand. A skill provides specialized workflows, setup instructions, helper scripts, and reference documentation for specific tasks.

Senpi implements the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io/specification), warning about most violations but remaining lenient. Senpi allows skill names to differ from their parent directory even though the standard disallows it; that rule is suboptimal for shared skill directories used across multiple agent harnesses.

## Locations

> **Security:** Skills can instruct the model to perform any action and may include executable code the model invokes. Review skill content before use.

Senpi loads skills from:

- Global:
  - `~/.senpi/agent/skills/`
  - `~/.agents/skills/`
- Project (only after the project is trusted):
  - `.senpi/skills/`
  - `.agents/skills/` in `cwd` and ancestor directories (up to git repo root, or filesystem root when not in a repo)
- Packages: `skills/` directories or `pi.skills` entries in `package.json`
- Settings: `skills` array with files or directories
- CLI: `--skill <path>` (repeatable, additive even with `--no-skills`)

Discovery rules:
- In `~/.senpi/agent/skills/` and `.senpi/skills/`, direct root `.md` files are discovered as individual skills when they have valid skill frontmatter with a non-empty `description`
- In all skill locations, directories containing `SKILL.md` are discovered recursively
- In `~/.agents/skills/` and project `.agents/skills/`, root `.md` files are ignored, but nested `.md` files in grouping folders are discovered when they declare skill frontmatter
- Root Markdown files other than `SKILL.md` that do not look like skills are ignored silently

Disable discovery with `--no-skills` (explicit `--skill` paths still load).

### Using Skills from Other Harnesses

To use skills from Claude Code or OpenAI Codex, add their directories to settings:

```json
{
  "skills": [
    "~/.claude/skills",
    "~/.codex/skills"
  ]
}
```

For project-level Claude Code skills, add to `.senpi/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "skills": ["../.claude/skills"]
}
```

## How Skills Work

1. At startup, senpi scans skill locations and extracts names and descriptions
2. The system prompt includes available skills in XML format per the [specification](https://agentskills.io/integrate-skills)
3. When a task matches, the agent uses `read` to load the full SKILL.md (models don't always do this; use prompting or `/skill:name` to force it)
4. The agent follows the instructions, using relative paths to reference scripts and assets

This is progressive disclosure: only descriptions are always in context, full instructions load on-demand.

## Skill Invocation

Skills register as `/skill:name` commands and also participate in the prompt-leading `$` picker:

```bash
/skill:brave-search           # Load and execute the skill
/skill:pdf-tools extract      # Load skill with arguments
$brave-search                 # Equivalent leading dollar invocation
```

Type `$` at the beginning of the interactive editor to browse commands and skills together. Selecting
a command inserts its canonical `/name ` form; selecting a skill inserts `$name `. Additional leading
`$` tokens reopen only the skill list, so multiple skills can be composed in source order.

OmO Desktop skill chips serialize as `$skill:name`. Senpi expands that explicit form even when it
appears inline. Bare inline dollar text remains literal, so `Use $HOME` and `explain $brave-search`
do not become skill invocations.

After resolving the explicit tokens, Senpi removes only those tokens and wraps the remaining text once
as the user request. Unknown tokens stay literal, duplicates are skipped, and at most five distinct
skills expand per prompt.

Toggle skill commands via `/settings` in interactive mode or in `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "enableSkillCommands": true
}
```

## Skill Structure

A skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` file. Everything else is freeform.

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md              # Required: frontmatter + instructions
├── mcp.json              # Optional: MCP servers bundled with the skill
├── scripts/              # Helper scripts
│   └── process.sh
├── references/           # Detailed docs loaded on-demand
│   └── api-reference.md
└── assets/
    └── template.json
```

### SKILL.md Format

````markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does and when to use it. Be specific.
---

# My Skill

## Setup

Run once before first use:
```bash
cd /path/to/skill && npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
./scripts/process.sh <input>
```
````

Use relative paths from the skill directory:

```markdown
See [the reference guide](references/REFERENCE.md) for details.
```

## Frontmatter

Per the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification#frontmatter-required):

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Max 64 chars. Lowercase a-z, 0-9, hyphens. Unlike the standard, Senpi does not require this to match the parent directory because that standard requirement is suboptimal for shared skill directories. |
| `description` | Yes | Max 1024 chars. What the skill does and when to use it. |
| `license` | No | License name or reference to bundled file. |
| `compatibility` | No | Max 500 chars. Environment requirements. |
| `metadata` | No | Arbitrary key-value mapping. |
| `allowed-tools` | No | Spec field for pre-approved tools. Senpi does not implement it; the field is ignored. |
| `disable-model-invocation` | No | When `true`, skill is hidden from system prompt. Users must use `/skill:name`. |

### Name Rules

- 1-64 characters
- Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only
- No leading/trailing hyphens
- No consecutive hyphens
Senpi does not require the name to match the parent directory. The Agent Skills standard does, but that requirement is suboptimal for shared skill directories used by multiple tools.

Valid: `pdf-processing`, `data-analysis`, `code-review`
Invalid: `PDF-Processing`, `-pdf`, `pdf--processing`

### Description Best Practices

The description determines when the agent loads the skill. Be specific.

Good:
```yaml
description: Extracts text and tables from PDF files, fills PDF forms, and merges multiple PDFs. Use when working with PDF documents.
```

Poor:
```yaml
description: Helps with PDFs.
```

## Carrying MCP Servers

A skill can bundle the MCP servers it uses, shipping the workflow and its
tools as one package. Servers declared by a skill register lazily with zero
active tools — they cost no prompt tokens until the skill loads, and the
tools matching the skill's `includeTools` globs activate for the session when
it does.

Declare servers in an `mcp.json` sidecar next to SKILL.md (or in a `mcp:`
frontmatter block):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "exa": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "exa-mcp-server"],
      "env": { "EXA_API_KEY": "${EXA_API_KEY}" },
      "includeTools": ["web_search*"]
    }
  }
}
```

See [Skill-carried MCP servers](mcp.md#skill-carried-mcp-servers) for the
full declaration forms, collision rules, and reveal semantics.

## Validation

Senpi validates skills against the Agent Skills standard. Most issues produce warnings but still load the skill:

- Name exceeds 64 characters or contains invalid characters
- Name starts/ends with hyphen or has consecutive hyphens
- Description exceeds 1024 characters

Unknown frontmatter fields are ignored.

Declared skills with missing descriptions are not loaded. Malformed `SKILL.md` files and `SKILL.md` files without a description produce warnings and are not loaded. Other Markdown files without valid skill frontmatter are ignored.

Name collisions (same name from different locations) warn and keep the first skill found.

## Example

```
brave-search/
├── SKILL.md
├── search.js
└── content.js
```

**SKILL.md:**
````markdown
---
name: brave-search
description: Web search and content extraction via Brave Search API. Use for searching documentation, facts, or any web content.
---

# Brave Search

## Setup

```bash
cd /path/to/brave-search && npm install
```

## Search

```bash
./search.js "query"              # Basic search
./search.js "query" --content    # Include page content
```

## Extract Page Content

```bash
./content.js https://example.com
```
````

## Bundled Skills

Senpi contributes built-in skills conditionally based on available credentials and capabilities.

**gpt-image-gen** is contributed by the `imagegen` builtin extension when image-generation credentials exist (a stored OpenAI key, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or a configured OpenAI-compatible gateway). It provides a prompt-crafting guide for `gpt-image-2`, covering detail-maxxing techniques, verbatim quoted render text, revised-prompt feedback loops, and routing guidance for the native server tool vs. the client `generate_image` tool. The skill is absent from `<available_skills>` when no credentials are configured.

Skill visibility refreshes at startup and on `/reload`. Mid-session credential changes (login, environment variable updates) take effect on the tool and injector immediately but are reflected in the skill list only after the next reload.
