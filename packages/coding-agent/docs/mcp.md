# MCP (Model Context Protocol)

senpi ships a built-in MCP client. Servers you configure expose their tools,
resources, and prompts to the agent with context-efficient defaults: a large
catalog costs almost nothing until the model actually needs it.

## Quickstart

1. Add a server to `<agentDir>/mcp.json` (global), `.senpi/mcp.json`
   (project), or import from `.mcp.json` (Claude format, via
   `settings.importConfigs`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "docs": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@example/docs-mcp"],
      "env": { "DOCS_TOKEN": "${DOCS_TOKEN}" }
    }
  }
}
```

2. Start senpi. Run `/mcp` for the interactive server manager, `/mcp status` for a one-line
   summary, `/mcp add <name> <command...>` to add servers interactively.
3. Servers needing OAuth: `/mcp auth <name>` (see [Auth](#auth)).
4. Use it: small catalogs register directly; big ones surface through
   `tool_search` (see [Exposure tiers](#exposure-tiers)).

## Interactive manager

`/mcp` lists servers with their connection state, tool and available resource
counts, exposure mode, and configuration source. Select a server to inspect its
tools, details, or logs; test or reconnect it; or sign in/out when OAuth applies.
The list updates when connections and catalogs change and preserves selection.
Navigation, confirmation, and cancellation use your configured keybindings.

Enable/disable and exposure changes are saved to the selected server's global
or trusted project `mcp.json`. Imported, skill-owned, extension-owned, and
untrusted definitions are read-only in this manager. OAuth actions close the
manager before running the existing authorization flow, keeping its notices
visible. Outside the TUI, `/mcp` reports status through the existing notification
channel; existing subcommands remain available.

## Configuration reference

Top-level shape: `{ "settings": { ... }, "mcpServers": { "<name>": { ... } } }`.

### Server fields (`mcpServers.<name>`)

### `type`
`"stdio" | "http"`. Default: inferred — `http` when `url` is set, else `stdio`.

### `url`
HTTP(S) endpoint for `type:"http"` servers (Streamable HTTP with SSE fallback).

### `command`
Executable for `type:"stdio"` servers. Never passed through a shell.

### `args`
Argument array for `command`. Default `[]`.

### `env`
Extra environment variables for the child process. Values support `${VAR}`
expansion from the trusted parent environment. The child does not inherit your
whole environment: it sees only `HOME`, `LOGNAME`, `PATH`, `SHELL`, `TERM`
and `USER` (on Windows, the system path and profile variables) plus `env`,
so pass every variable the server reads through `env`.

### `cwd`
Working directory for the child process. Default: the session cwd.

### `headers`
Extra HTTP headers for `type:"http"` servers.

### `auth`
`"bearer" | "oauth" | false`. Default: autodetected — `bearerTokenEnv` or an
`Authorization` header implies `bearer`; a 401 from an HTTP server triggers the
OAuth flow. `false` disables auth entirely.

### `bearerTokenEnv`
Name of the environment variable holding a bearer token (the value itself
never lives in config; literal-looking tokens in config produce a warning).

### `oauth`
OAuth tuning: `clientId`, `callbackPort` (default: ephemeral),
`scopes`, `clientMetadataUrl`, `flow` (`"code"` default, or
`"client_credentials"` for headless machine-to-machine).

### `enabled`
Default `true`. Disabled servers stay in config but never spawn.

### `lifecycle`
`"lazy"` (default: connect on first use), `"eager"` (connect at session start),
`"keep-alive"` (eager + 30s pings + automatic reconnect; never idles out).

### `idleTimeoutMin`
Minutes of zero in-flight calls before a connected server is shut down (its
tools stay registered; the next call reconnects transparently). Default `10`.

### `requestTimeoutMs`
Per-request timeout. Default `30000`.

### `connectTimeoutMs`
Connect + initialize handshake timeout. Default `15000`.

### `startupTimeoutMs`
Bounded startup window (ms) that a server's first connect + catalog fetch is
raced against during session attach. A server that does not settle inside the
window keeps connecting in the background and surfaces its tools when ready, so
a slow or wedged server never blocks the first turn. Default `250`. Set higher
to wait for tools before the first turn, `0` to never wait. The
`SENPI_MCP_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_MS` environment variable overrides this for every
server.

### `includeTools`
Glob allowlist (`*` wildcards) over server-side tool names. Default: all.

### `excludeTools`
Glob denylist applied after `includeTools`.

### `directTools`
`true` = every filtered tool active immediately; or an array of names/globs
that stay active while the rest goes behind `tool_search`. Default: none.

### `exposure`
`"auto"` (default), `"direct"`, `"search"`, or `"proxy"`. See
[Exposure tiers](#exposure-tiers). `auto` never selects `proxy`.

### `logLevel`
Minimum RFC-5424 level (`debug`…`emergency`) for the server's
`notifications/message` log stream. Default: record everything (rate-capped).

### Settings fields (`settings`)

### `toolPrefix`
Prefix for registered tool names (`<prefix>_<server>_<tool>`). Default `"mcp"`.

### `searchThreshold`
Filtered-tool count above which `auto` switches a server to search mode.
Default `10`.

### `outputGuard`
Caps on tool/resource output: `maxBytes` (default 51200), `maxLines`
(default 2000), `maxTokens`. Oversized output is truncated with a notice and
the full artifact is written to disk.

### `importConfigs`
`["claude"]` imports `.mcp.json` (Claude Code format) from the project root.
Imported servers require project trust.

### `oauthCallbackUrl`
Override the OAuth loopback callback URL (e.g. behind port forwarding).

### `stubSwap`
Opt-in prompt-cache mitigation for search mode: every inactive tool registers
as a 30-70-token stub so the tools array stays length-stable; activation swaps
the stub for the full schema in place. Default `false`.

### `nativeToolSearch`
`"auto"` (default) | `true` | `false`. On Anthropic models, defers inactive
MCP tools to the provider's native tool-search; any 400 falls back to the
local `tool_search` for the session.

## Exposure tiers

> **Note:** `tool_search` is a shared catalog tool that covers both MCP servers and native extension tools. When filtering searches, the legacy MCP `server` parameter is mapped to the shared `group` parameter.

| Tier | When | Cost profile |
|---|---|---|
| direct | `exposure:"direct"`, `directTools:true`, or `auto` at/below `searchThreshold` | Every tool schema on every request |
| search (Tier-B) | `exposure:"search"` or `auto` above the threshold | Full catalog registered, ~135 tokens resident (`tool_search` only); matches promote next turn; promotions survive resume/compaction |
| proxy (Tier-C) | `exposure:"proxy"` only — never `auto` | One `mcp_<server>` gateway tool (`search`/`describe`/`call` with JSON-string args); cheapest, but no provider-side argument validation |

Skills can carry MCP servers too — see
[Skill-carried MCP servers](#skill-carried-mcp-servers).

### Server sources

Servers are merged from these sources, in precedence order:

- `global` — `<agentDir>/mcp.json`
- `claude` — imported `.mcp.json` (requires project trust)
- `project` — `.senpi/mcp.json` (requires project trust)
- `extension` — declared by an extension via `pi.registerMcpServer()` during
  factory load (see [extensions.md](extensions.md#piregistermcpservername-config))
- `skill` — declared in a skill's `mcp.json` sidecar or SKILL.md frontmatter

A name collision resolves as follows: trusted user config (including an
`enabled: false` entry) wins over extension declarations; an extension
declaration replaces an untrusted placeholder and records a diagnostic.
Extension-declared servers use bare names (no prefix).

## Skill-carried MCP servers

A skill can bundle the MCP servers it needs, so the workflow and its tools
travel as one package. Skill-declared servers register lazily with **zero
active tools** — they cost no prompt tokens until the skill loads. Loading the
skill (a `/skill:<name>` command, or the model reading its SKILL.md) reveals
the tools matching its `includeTools` globs for the rest of the session.

Two declaration forms exist; the sidecar wins when both are present.

**`mcp.json` sidecar** (Amp-compatible) next to SKILL.md. Servers accept the
same fields as [`mcpServers.<name>`](#server-fields-mcpserversname), plus
`includeTools`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "exa": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "exa-mcp-server"],
      "env": { "EXA_API_KEY": "${EXA_API_KEY}" },
      "includeTools": ["web_search*"]
    }
  }
}
```

The `mcpServers` wrapper is optional — a bare server-name map works too.
When you installed the skill, `${EXA_API_KEY}` expands from your environment
exactly as it would in your own `mcp.json`; see
[Environment variables in skill servers](#environment-variables-in-skill-servers).

**Frontmatter `mcp:` block** in SKILL.md:

````markdown
---
name: exa-search
description: Web search via Exa. Use for finding current documentation.
mcp:
  exa:
    command: npx
    args: ["-y", "exa-mcp-server"]
    env:
      EXA_API_KEY: ${EXA_API_KEY}
    includeTools: ["web_search*"]
---
````

Semantics:

- `includeTools` is a glob allowlist (`*` wildcards) over server-side tool
  names; default `["*"]` (every tool). Skill servers are forced into search
  mode with no `directTools`, so nothing is active before the skill loads
  regardless of any declared `exposure`.
- Several skills declaring the same server name: the first configuration
  wins; `includeTools` union-merges across the declaring skills, and loading
  any one of them reveals the merged matches.
- A name collision with a configured server resolves in favor of your config,
  so a skill never overrides a server you already trust.
- An unreadable sidecar or frontmatter `mcp:` block is skipped with a
  warning; the skill itself still loads.
- There is no unload signal: tools revealed by a skill stay active until the
  session ends.

### Environment variables in skill servers

`${VAR}` expansion follows the trust of the skill that declares the server,
the same line senpi draws for `mcp.json` files:

- **Skills you own** (your user skills directory, packages you installed, and
  the skills of a project you trusted): stdio `command`, `args`, `env` and
  `cwd` expand exactly like your own `mcp.json`, including `${VAR:-default}`
  and the refusal of command substitution (a server asking for `$(...)` or a
  leading `!` is skipped with a warning).
- **Skills of an untrusted project**: nothing expands. The placeholder stays
  literal and senpi warns once, naming the skill and the variable; trust the
  project or declare the server in your own `mcp.json` to expand it. A cloned
  repository must not be able to hand `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` to a command it
  chose.
- **Remote servers from any skill**: `url` and `headers` never expand, and
  `bearerTokenEnv` is ignored, so no `Authorization` header is sent. Expanding
  them would send your secrets to a server the skill picked. senpi warns once
  per server; declare the server in your own `mcp.json`, where variables and
  `bearerTokenEnv` keep working.

## Resources and prompts

- `mcp_list_resources` / `mcp_read_resource` register automatically when a
  connected server lists resources.
- Mention `@mcp:<server>/<uri>` in your prompt to inline a resource's content
  into the message; unknown or failing mentions are left untouched with a
  notice.
- Every server prompt registers as `/mcp:<server>:<prompt>`; invoking it
  collects the prompt's arguments and drops the rendered text into the editor.
- Servers may ask questions mid-call (elicitation, form mode): senpi walks the
  requested fields through input dialogs; in non-interactive runs the request
  is declined cleanly.

## Auth

- **Bearer**: set `bearerTokenEnv` (recommended) or an `Authorization` header.
- **OAuth (interactive)**: `/mcp auth <name>` opens the browser for the
  authorization-code + PKCE flow after the loopback callback is ready. The
  complete authorization URL stays in the transcript if the browser cannot
  open, so you can open it manually. Tokens persist under `<agentDir>` with
  `0600` permissions and refresh automatically (single-flight across
  processes).
- **OAuth (headless)**: `flow:"client_credentials"` for machine-to-machine, or
  `/mcp auth-start <name>` to obtain an authorization URL, followed by
  `/mcp auth-complete <name> <redirect-url>` to paste the final redirect URL
  from another browser/machine in the same session.
- `/mcp logout <name>` clears stored tokens.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom (`/mcp status`) | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `needs_auth` | 401 and no usable token | `/mcp auth <name>` |
| `suspended` | reconnect circuit breaker opened (5 failures/30s) | fix the server, then `/mcp reconnect <name>` |
| `degraded` | transient failure; auto-reconnect with backoff is running | wait, or `/mcp reconnect <name>` |
| tools missing | server filtered/disabled, or hidden behind search | check `includeTools`/`excludeTools`, ask the model to `tool_search` |
| child exits at spawn (EOF) | bad `command`/`args`/`env` | `/mcp logs <name>` shows the captured stderr |
| slow first call | lazy server cold boot (tools attach in the background) | raise `startupTimeoutMs`, or use `lifecycle:"eager"` / `"keep-alive"` |

## Security notes

- Config values never pass through a shell; `${VAR}` expansion only reads the
  trusted parent environment, and only for trusted sources: your own and a
  trusted project's config, and stdio servers of skills you own. Skill remote
  servers never expand variables or send `bearerTokenEnv` (see
  [Environment variables in skill servers](#environment-variables-in-skill-servers)).
- Project-level and imported configs require project trust before servers
  spawn; untrusted entries are listed but inert.
- Tokens are stored `0600` and never logged; server log streams and tool
  output are redacted by the same secret scrubber as the rest of senpi and
  capped by `outputGuard`.

## Disabling MCP entirely

Add the builtin to your settings' disabled list — no other configuration is
needed:

```json
{ "disabledBuiltinExtensions": ["mcp"] }
```
