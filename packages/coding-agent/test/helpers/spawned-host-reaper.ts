/**
 * Teardown for test hosts that outlive the handle that started them.
 *
 * A suite can always kill the child it spawned, but these tests also make PRODUCTION code spawn
 * hosts: `ensureHost` detaches its child and hands back only a pid, and some cases deliberately
 * leave a registration the teardown cannot act on (an unguarded pidfile, a failed ensure that
 * cleaned its own state). Nothing in the suite holds those processes, so "kill the children I
 * remember" leaves them running - measured: fixture hosts alive for hours, long after the temp
 * directories they were started in were gone.
 *
 * Every host a case can start is named after its own sandbox directory (the socket path is inside
 * it), so the sandbox is the reliable handle: reap by argv, then wait until the pid is really gone
 * before the directory is removed.
