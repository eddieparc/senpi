 * pidfile is written. That cleanup kill sets the same `exitedEarly` record the
 * child's own exit would, so the catch block mistook its own SIGTERM for the
 * host dying unprompted, dropped the real error, and reported "exited with code
 * null (SIGTERM) before answering get_protocol_info". On the windows-latest
 * runner that made every genuine startup failure unobservable and was reported
 * as the flake in code-yeongyu/senpi#1290.
