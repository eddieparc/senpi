/**
 * senpi#1844: the in-process daemon serializes concurrent open_session, so a burst crosses the
 * 30 s open deadline and the client sees only "Timeout waiting for response to open_session.
 * Stderr: " - nothing after it. A queued open must tell its client WHERE it is, before the open
 * enters the loop, so a deadline miss can name its cause instead of arriving as silence.
 *
 * The record carries the requester's id under `for_request`, never under the response-id field:
 * a desktop client settles pending requests by response id, and a queued record wearing the
 * open's id would be taken as the open's reply.
