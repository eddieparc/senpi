/**
 * Vitest setup: quarantine inherited branded agent/package directory overrides so the test suite
 * never writes session JSONLs into the user's real `~/.senpi/agent/sessions/` or loads assets from
 * an installed runtime instead of this checkout.
 *
 * Many tests call `SessionManager.create(tempDir)` without an explicit
 * sessionDir. That falls back to `getDefaultSessionDir(cwd)` → `getAgentDir()`,
 * which reads this env var. If unset, it resolves to the developer's real
 * $HOME and leaves faux-provider JSONLs there permanently, where downstream
 * tools (e.g. tokscale) then mis-count them as real usage.
