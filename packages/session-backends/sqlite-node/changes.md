# changes.md - sqlite-node

## 2026-09-30 - Sync with upstream v0.99.1 (6a4af07d6): chord, client, protocol, server, telemetry, sqlite-node

### What changed

- `packages/session-backends/sqlite-node/package.json`: resolved by L11 against upstream v0.99.1 (6a4af07d6): upstream constructs adopted, fork behavior kept.

### Why

Upstream v0.99.1 (6a4af07d6) changed these paths while the fork carries its own behavior; chord/client/protocol/server/telemetry/sqlite-node take upstream versions with fork exact pins (plan D-12).

### Why an extension could not handle it

Package manifests and wire-protocol packages are shared infrastructure below the extension layer.

### Expected merge conflict zones

Every path listed above conflicts again where upstream edits the hunks named in its line; the fork-kept constructs named there are the anchors to preserve.

## 2026-09-21 - Migrate the test runner to Vitest 5 (senpi#1895)

### What changed

- `packages/session-backends/sqlite-node/package.json`: Updated the test runner to Vitest 5.0.1 and V8 coverage to @vitest/coverage-v8 5.0.1.

### Why

- Run this workspace on the pinned Vitest 5 release.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- The package manager resolves development tools before extensions load.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- The development dependency pins in `packages/session-backends/sqlite-node/package.json`.

## 2026-09-12 - Adopt upstream's simplified SQLite session repository

### What changed

- `packages/session-backends/sqlite-node/src/sqlite/repo.ts` and `src/sqlite/index.ts`: taken from upstream (`Q-A=upstream-sqlite`), along with upstream's test organization and `session/` storage modules.
- Dropped the fork-only `src/sqlite/storage/lanes.ts`, `src/sqlite/storage/records.ts`, `src/sqlite/storage/facts.ts`, and `src/sqlite/storage/writer-leases.ts` (lane-scoped operation records, global facts, fenced writer leases) together with `src/sqlite/branch-cache.ts`, `src/sqlite/search-backend.ts`, and their tests (`test/branch-cache.test.ts`, `test/facts-query.test.ts`, `test/search.test.ts`). Upstream's schema (`sessions`, `entries`, scalar and list values, `usage_ledger`, `branch_entries`, `branch_meta`) has no home for them.
- The rich `SqliteSessionRepository` API in `src/sqlite/repo.ts` and `src/sqlite/index.ts` is replaced by upstream's `SqliteSessionRepo`.
- The fork's 2026-09-05 delta (decode durable GPT-6 Astra `configuration_update` entries with reasoning-effort validation in `src/sqlite/repo.ts`, plus its `test/repository.test.ts` round-trip case) is dropped on purpose: upstream's `Entry` union no longer has a `configuration_update` member, and the shipped CLI JSONL session path keeps its own Astra configuration handling in `packages/coding-agent`. The 2026-09-05 block below stays as history.

### Why

- Upstream rewrote the backend around its runtime/drive harness generation; carrying the fork's richer schema forward would mean re-implementing the whole repository against contracts the harness no longer exposes. The package is private and nothing in the shipped `senpi` CLI imports it.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Session storage backends are wired below the extension layer; an extension cannot change the durable schema or replace `SessionRepo`.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `src/sqlite/repo.ts`, `src/sqlite/index.ts`, `src/sqlite/migrations/001_initial.sql`, and every file under `src/sqlite/storage/` (fork) versus `src/sqlite/session/` (upstream) on the next sync. Expect deletions on the fork side, not edits.

## 2026-09-10 - Use native TypeScript builds for omob performance

### What changed

- packages/session-backends/sqlite-node/package.json: build uses tsgo for the emitted workspace build.

### Why

- The native compiler reduces omob build time without changing runtime JavaScript.

### Why this lives in the fork

- The package build manifest owns the compiler used by the fork's release pipeline.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- The `build` script in packages/session-backends/sqlite-node/package.json.

## 2026-09-05 - Decode Astra configuration-update session entries

### What changed

- packages/session-backends/sqlite-node/src/sqlite/repo.ts: decode durable GPT-6 Astra configuration_update entries with reasoning-effort validation.

### Why

- SQLite resume must preserve the durable configuration transition used by the Responses cache contract.

### Why this lives in the fork

- The backend owns durable entry decoding before the session layer can replay it.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- SQLite entry decoding and session schema compatibility.


## 2026-09-12 - Upstream sync (upstream/main@71dca871) integration repairs

### What changed

- `packages/session-backends/sqlite-node/package.json`: keeps the fork name `@earendil-works/pi-storage-sqlite-node` at `0.83.0` (excluded from the CalVer lockstep by `scripts/sync-versions.js`), `private: true`, `@earendil-works/pi-ai`/`pi-agent-core` at `^2026.9.12`, `vitest`/`@vitest/coverage-v8 4.1.11`; upstream's simplified sqlite model and build script were adopted (Q-A).

### Why

- The backend is unpublished in the fork and must resolve the fork's internal workspace ranges.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Manifest fields are resolved by the package manager.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: `name`, `version` and dependency lines on upstream release bumps.
