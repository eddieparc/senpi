Commit: `baf15a54d` (2026-08-24)

`@earendil-works/pi-tui` is the standalone terminal renderer/editor library used by Senpi interactive mode. Rendering uses synchronized, differential frames and must preserve terminal ownership boundaries.

## RENDERING CONTRACT

- Balanced synchronized-output/autowrap frame guards on every render path; stable-width streaming updates stay differential with no clear-screen operations.
- Resize, recovery, scrollback replay, multiplexer, and image branches may legitimately repaint or clear when their contracts require it.
- `start()` and `stop()` reset queued render state so stale scheduled frames cannot leak across lifecycles.
- `ProcessTerminal` owns external stdout while running; components must not write around it.
- Terminal title output strips control characters.
- Visible tabs are normalized to a fixed three-column width at the terminal-output boundary; ANSI/OSC/APC escape sequences are untouched (`test/tab-width.test.ts`).
- High-frequency consumer components are responsible for memoization; preserve the Senpi streaming caches.

## WHERE TO LOOK

| Task | File |
|---|---|
| Flicker, cursor, viewport (`isViewportTUI`, `VIEWPORT_TUI`) | `src/tui.ts` |
| Alt-screen rendering, scroll wheel/keys routing | `src/tui-alt-screen.ts` |
| Layout rects, clipping, scrollbar geometry | `src/layout.ts`, `src/layout-node.ts` |
| Stack sizing, scrollable regions | `src/components/stack.ts`, `src/components/scroll-view.ts` |
| Terminal lifecycle/title, child process terminal | `src/terminal.ts` (`ProcessTerminal`) |
| Key parsing/defaults | `src/keys.ts`, `src/keybindings.ts` |
| Paste handling | `src/stdin-buffer.ts` |
| Width/wrapping, output normalization, tab width | `src/utils.ts` (`normalizeTerminalOutput`, `visibleWidth`) |
| Images | `src/terminal-image.ts` |
| $-invocation autocomplete | `src/dollar-invocation-autocomplete.ts`, `src/autocomplete.ts` (`CombinedAutocompleteProvider`) |

## $-INVOCATION

- A `$` token at a whitespace boundary on any logical prompt line — the first line, a line after `shift+enter`, or a line from a multiline paste — opens the popup however many `$` tokens precede it, so one prompt can carry several skill mentions. As the first token it offers the same candidate list as `/` (slash commands insert as `/name`, skills as bare `$name`); anywhere else it offers skills only.
- A token that already names a known skill closes the popup so `enter` submits. A `$` that is not at a token boundary, and shell-style expansions such as `$HOME` or `$1`, stay literal.
- Completion application must preserve trailing-space behavior for both `/command ` and `$skill ` forms.
- Resolved skill mentions (`$name` / `$skill:name` naming a known skill) are reported by `CombinedAutocompleteProvider.getMentionRanges(line)` (`findDollarSkillMentions` in `dollar-invocation-autocomplete.ts`) and the `Editor` styles them through the optional `EditorTheme.mention` hook; row composition lives in `components/editor-line-render.ts` so the cursor grapheme and each mention fragment are styled independently.

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- Replacing differential rendering with unconditional full redraws.
- Unbalanced frame guards or cursor bookkeeping outside `tui.ts`.
- Direct `console.log` or `process.stdout.write` from components.
- Required native dependencies; optional native capabilities load lazily.
- Hardcoded application keybindings in library components.

## VALIDATION

- Tests use `node --test --import tsx`, not Vitest; the test script also imports `test/setup-multiplexer-env.mjs`. Run `bun run test` from this package.
- Alt-screen/layout changes: see `test/tui-alt-screen.test.ts`, `test/layout.test.ts`, `test/viewport-render.test.ts`.
- Rendering changes must include focused headless-terminal assertions and preserve flicker budgets.
- Runtime changes require root `bun run check`, `senpi-qa` TUI smoke evidence, and visual terminal QA.
- Read `src/changes.md` before altering renderer or loader behavior.
- Native modifier binaries: `bun run build:native:darwin`; `bun run build:native:win32` (toolchain via `PI_TUI_WIN32_TOOLCHAIN=msvc|mingw`).
