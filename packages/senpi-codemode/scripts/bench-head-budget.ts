/**
 * Absolute head budgets for rows whose base-ratio gate cannot be met by design. A row listed here is judged on
 * the head alone: every head repetition must do the complete work, and the head's median wall time must stay
 * under a ceiling. Pure: no I/O, no clocks.
 *
 * crash-queue-100 on rb and jl: the base (before the queued-cell recovery work) never recovered from the crash.
 * Every queued cell failed (queuedFailed 100, 0 replacements) in about 20 ms, so head/base compares a failure
 * path with the real work. The ceilings are twice the head medians of a calm 2026-10-09 run on an Apple M5 Max
 * laptop on AC (wall: rb 410 ms, jl 1332 ms; cpu: rb 173 ms, jl 937 ms), so a regression in the recovery path still
 * fails. They are absolute, so a much slower host can trip them on a correct head: rerun on a calm host first.
