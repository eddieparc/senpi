# Vendored: @earendil-works/pi-codemode 1.0.1

- Upstream: https://github.com/earendil-works/pi, directory `packages/codemode/src`
- Tag `v1.0.1`, commit `a7229ddc21810d6245105978033b7df645ecc2f7` (`packages/codemode/package.json` version 1.0.1)
- License: MIT, upstream `LICENSE` copied unchanged beside this file.
- Why vendored: the published package ships compiled `dist` only, and senpi needs three host changes that are not in any release (listed below once they land). Vendoring the source keeps them in this repository, so a registry consumer receives them.

## Provenance

Building `packages/codemode` at that commit with its pinned compiler (`typescript` 7.0.2, `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json`) reproduces all 40 files of the published npm `@earendil-works/pi-codemode@1.0.1` `dist` byte for byte, so this source is the released code.

Each file below starts with a two-line attribution header. `wasm.ts` and `identifier.ts` are otherwise the upstream file unchanged. The other five carry the local changes listed below, and nothing else: outside the `senpi-change` blocks and the lines marked `// senpi-change`, every line is upstream's, in upstream's order. The SHA-256 is of the upstream file.

Only these seven files are vendored: the closure of `runtime/host.ts` (the sandbox host). `index.ts`, `source.ts` and `declarations.ts` are not used.

## Local changes

Every change is marked, in one of two ways, so a sync can find each one:

- a block between `// senpi-change begin: <topic>` and `// senpi-change end`, which adds code or replaces the upstream lines it stands in place of (for example `types.ts`'s `CodemodeResult`, and the end of `finish()` in `runtime/host.ts`);
- a single upstream line edited in place, ending in `// senpi-change` (an extra import name, the `"output-frame"` message type in `isWorkerToHostMessage`, the prelude's `optionsJson` parameter and its stream-mode output-cap condition).

A sync must re-apply both kinds: dropping a marked line (for example `"output-frame"` in the protocol guard) would make the host ignore every frame. Each one is an option whose default is upstream's behaviour: with the defaults, the ported upstream suite (`test/sandbox/vendor/upstream-sandbox.test.ts`, 47 cases, only its imports changed) passes unchanged.

1. **Output streaming** (`output: "stream"`, `onOutputFrame`, `windowBytes`, `frameBytes`; `types.ts`, `runtime/protocol.ts`, `runtime/worker.ts`, `runtime/host.ts`, `runtime/prelude-source.ts`). Upstream keeps every output item until the script settles, which is why it caps output at 16 Mi characters. In stream mode:
   - The host keeps nothing; `result.output` stays empty and `result.streamed` reports frames and the peak bytes in flight.
   - The worker splits each item into frames of at most `frameBytes` (default 64 KiB), never splitting a surrogate pair, tagged with item id, sequence and a final flag.
   - It sends a frame only after taking that many bytes from a shared credit counter (default window 256 KiB). It sleeps on the counter with `Atomics.wait` while the window is full, and re-checks the interrupt flag each time it wakes.
   - The host hands frames to the consumer one at a time, in order, and returns their credit only once the consumer has finished. The output cap does not apply, because memory is bounded by the window.
   - A normal finish settles only after every frame is consumed. An abort or timeout settles at once and drops frames still queued. The timer and the abort signal stay armed while a finished run's last frames drain, so a late abort, timeout or `close()` abandons them too (the run settles with that error): a consumer that never returns cannot keep a run alive.
   - `frameBytes` and `windowBytes` must be at least 4, so a frame can always hold a whole surrogate pair.
2. **Builtin store policy** (`builtins: { store: "collect" | "reject" }`; `types.ts`, `runtime/protocol.ts`, `runtime/worker.ts`, `runtime/host.ts`, `runtime/prelude-source.ts`). With `"reject"`, `load()` returns `undefined` and `store()` throws `CodemodeStoreDisabledError`. The names stay defined, so scripts written for upstream fail with a clear message instead of a ReferenceError.
3. **Runtime-set error reasons** (`types.ts` `CodemodeError.reason`, `runtime/prelude-source.ts`, `runtime/worker.ts`). The prelude captures the engine's own `InternalError` before user code runs and tags a failure `reason: "memory"` only for an instance of it whose message is exactly "out of memory"; its stalled-promise failure is tagged `reason: "unresolved"`; the worker tags an engine out-of-memory from `evalCode` the same way; and `text()` rethrows the engine's own error instead of replacing it with a `TypeError`. The host maps the isolate error codes from `reason` only, never from message text. Upstream has no `reason`, so its behaviour is unchanged.
