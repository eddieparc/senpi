# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Publish-only releases now ship the native PTY prebuild for every supported target (darwin-arm64, darwin-x64, linux-x64, linux-arm64, win32-x64), so Linux x64 and the other newly shipped targets get the real native PTY backend instead of the pipe fallback. The publish fails when a required prebuild is missing from the tarball; win32-arm64 stays best-effort. Thanks @Altairpaca. ([#1224](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/pull/1224), fixes [#1193](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/1193))

- `TerminalSession` exposes the child's `pid` on every backend (native, pipe fallback, Bun) and its `processGroupId` where the backend knows it (native and pipe fallback), so callers can record the process identity of a session. ([#2108](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2108))
- Added `TerminalSession.terminate({ signal, graceMs, forcedGraceMs })`, which signals the session, waits for the exit, escalates to `SIGKILL`, and resolves with the settled exit (or `null` when the process outlives both waits).
- Added `SessionRegistry` options `forcedExitGraceMs` (wait after the escalated `SIGKILL`, default 1s) and `detachedExitGraceMs` (detached-child grace before `SIGKILL`, default 1s).
- Added an opt-in Bun `Bun.spawn` terminal backend for persistent PTY sessions when `SENPI_BUN_TERMINAL` is truthy; the existing native and pipe-fallback paths remain the defaults.

### Fixed

- `TerminalSession.kill()` no longer swallows an escalation: repeating the last delivered signal stays idempotent, but a different signal (notably `SIGKILL` after an ignored `SIGTERM`) now reaches the backend.
- `SessionRegistry.stop()` escalates to `SIGKILL` when a session outlives the stop grace and reports `stopping` only if the process survives that too; `teardown()` escalates a still-live entry before dropping it instead of abandoning the process.
- Detached-child cleanup now SIGKILLs children still alive after the SIGTERM grace, through both the tracked `kill` callback and the process-group/pid path.
- A native terminal session's output no longer gains a stray `\r\n` when other sessions are spawned at the same time. ([#2161](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/2161))

### Changed

- Updated the development dependencies: @types/node 26.2.0 -> 26.6.2. ([#1895](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/senpi/issues/1895))
