/**
 * Live spike: in-session mechanisms of one resident streaming-input query
 * (Wave A todo 2).
 *
 * One query, four turns:
 *   turn 1  normal exchange, records the system/init session_id + capabilities
 *   setModel(<other claude model>) between turns
 *   turn 2  asserts the SAME session_id and that the response model changed
 *   turn 3  interrupted mid-flight — the interrupt is issued from the FIRST
 *           streamed content delta, while the model is still producing output,
 *           so the spike actually exercises interruption instead of cancelling
 *           an already-finished turn; the receipt shape is recorded
 *           (still_queued present => v1, undefined => legacy, throw => failed)
 *   turn 4  continuation on the SAME query; coherence is proven by the model
 *           recalling the turn-1 token
 *
 * Usage:
 *   SENPI_LIVE_CLAUDE_SDK_OAUTH=1 SENPI_CODING_AGENT_DIR=<sandbox> \
 *     node .agents/skills/senpi-qa/scripts/anthropic-subscription-native-inline-spike.mjs
 *
 * Outcomes (final line):
 *   exit 0 "ACCEPTED setmodel=<ok|absent> interrupt_receipt=<v1|legacy> continue=coherent"
 *   exit 2 "REJECTED signal=<sanitized>"
 * An interrupt that never happened REJECTS (interrupt_failed) instead of being
 * reported as a legacy receipt — a spike that proved nothing must not ACCEPT.
 * Never prints token material.
